Honest money that is not created as debt is the start of an answer. It will not solve the ECOE issue but it will allow proper Market pricing. Dishonest money excludes the possibility of Free markets and indeed a form of competitive capitalism or/and indeed Liberty in the conservative political sense.

John, Money represents an IOU. When I refer to Debt-based money I refer to money created at interest without the Interest component, this story and my use of the phrase Debt-based money is told in letters parable of the 11th round.

A credit-based money of commerce is very different to a Debt based money of commerce and the use of Tims all money is a claim is a good starting point.

The second question that arises is that of asymmetric risk or skin in the game.]]></description>

My understanding – though I’d welcome correction or further information – is that trees don’t start absorbing carbon until they are 30 years old. So a tree planted now won’t do this until 2050. Yet tree-planting seems to be every industry’s “get out of gaol free” card.

Where did you get this idea from Tim, It makes no sense. Trees Synthesise many minerals from the ground but also Carbon from the air, the more Carbon there is in the Air the less water plants need in general.

Thanks – I still find it hard to imagine saplings absorbing much carbon. Fortunately, I have a family member who recently took an honours First in environmental sciences, so I’ll ask his views.

But as we may ourselves any day see,

the more the wood or coal, the more the fire,

just so increase of hope, from wherever it be,

full often with it increases the desire:

just as an oak comes from a little spire,

There is every reason to doubt the BBC’s report on the new report, The BBC and Roger Harribin are alarmist extremists, there’s no sugar-coating that pill or indeed the same conclusion of Mr Monbiot at the Guardian. Jamie Dimon’s Report last Spring (2019) https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PR-TCFD-1000-Supporters_FINAL.pdf This JP Morgan report is rather good Mountains and Molehills. The Green New Deal mandates zero net emissions for the US by 2030 for the entire energy sector (not just from electricity generation), and does so while phasing out nuclear power and relying heavily on carbon sequestration by forests. This sets a goal that cannot be achieved. At best, the Green New Deal is a slogan to galvanize support for change; at worst, it’s a sign of how little work its proponents have done. This year’s paper gets into the details of where energy comes from, how it’s used, and the de-carbonization challenges facing the world’s industrialized and emerging economies. Additional topics include the latest research on wildfires, and Trump’s War on Science. http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JPM.2019.pdf There is every reason to doubt the BBC’s report on the new report, The BBC and Roger Harribin are alarmist extremists, there’s no sugar-coating that pill or indeed the same conclusion of Mr Monbiot at the Guardian.
