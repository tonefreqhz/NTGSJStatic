I have responded here but the comment has not been published. It is copy and pasted onto my own blog.
Regarding the charge of Diatribe and Esoteric utopian theories, I have not made any such arguments or any appeals to Authority. No, I do not propose pitchforks I subscribe to Erica Chernowerths research that non-violent civil resistance is what works and is the only plausible action in a State apparatus where the monopoly on violence and as you say access to instruments of surveillance capitalism are at the disposal of the current corrupted establishment leadership and being used with increasing frequency in France and the United States as well as in the so-called failed rogue states.
Regarding your religious atheism Steven, your own zealotry does not convert into better arguments for the case you continually fail to make.
Regarding the philosophy of mind and atomistic reductionist world view to which you claim no alternative Electro Magnetism is non-pyhsical, no one knows many of the answers that you claim to be settled, they simply are not.]]></description>

Talk about ‚Äúappeal to authority‚Äù <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

My name is mentioned once in your 1000 word diatribe. I‚Äôm familiar with M. Kennedy‚Äôs work, and much else that you paste here.

Questions:

How does it change (from human intentionality and action) *sooner* than system crash or multiple decades long natural evolution? Do you propose pitchforks at a time when drones can control mobs? Why direct your energy at esoteric utopian theories?

I hate fiat/credit based money too. But as our host says, this is what we‚Äôre stuck with now. You like to curse at the powerful and call them names. I choose instead to deal with probabilities going forward that will affect my son and grandsons, and small responses I can take in educating them with old skills as well as insights into system fragility/brittleness.

Steven,
The sort of Name dropping you indulge your self in is an appeal to authority, Citing Sources with their own reasoning is not appealing to Authority it is the presentation of Argument and data as evidence.
I know you are upset that you think I have not shown your wished-for level of deference to your ‚ÄúSystems Paper on Over-Population‚Äù, It is outdated and also superficial on its treatment of the subject. I spent a good deal of time structuring a reasoned argument in response, again citing evidence and data which is checkable, and challengeable and you responded with abusive emails and continued sour grapes on this site.

What I have presented here in this discussion thread is all publicly available for review and readers here and elsewhere can make up their own minds. Your own feelings on the matter are of no interest to me Steven.
Enjoy the rest of your day. I am getting ready for a business trip to London, maybe even to meet with Dominic Cummings for an interview. I‚Äôll let you all know how I get on.
With Best wishes and no Animus,
Roger]]></description>
