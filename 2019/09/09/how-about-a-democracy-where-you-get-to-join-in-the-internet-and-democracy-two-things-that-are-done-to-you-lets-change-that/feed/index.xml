Interesting Blog JW. Are you proposing anarchy or the simple changing of one set of tyrants for another set?

Did you place the Pingback at the top of the comments section? Did you look at it? Lots of links to other blogs and tweetfeeds. Plus a few diagrams of things and people of differences.

What seems interesting was all these things and people were of endless variety, but after passing through the funnel shaped machine [education, local and national conventions] we all appear out of the end of the funnel the same?

Nothing new in that, thinkers have always known we might start of in life with different lifestyles and life chances, not to mention different abilities in the way we make use of these choices. But in the end we learn to conform [at least appear to] and in the end we end up simply as a memory and dust.

@ KJH Jean Monnet, one of the EU founders, described its structure as a ‘benign despotism’. The elected European Parliament has no power to propose and pass laws. The EU was explicitly constructed on a non-electoral basis. Unfortunately, there is no control mechanism to stop ‘benign’ changing into ‘sinister’.

True but as not our supposed betters? Always thought/believed that the plebs/proles have not sufficient intelligence to vote, hence the two party system and its sham democracy. It creates the illusion of choice, but in reality the system rules.

@Derek Reynolds; Completely agree and have forwarded your comments [under my name to my MP]

Liked by you
