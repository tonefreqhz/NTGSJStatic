<p>Chapter I<br>
Ignorance is Strength<br>
Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,<br>
there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and<br>
117</p>
<p>the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless<br>
different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards<br>
one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society<br>
has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable<br>
changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will<br>
always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed one way or the other</p>
<p>The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the<br>
High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places<br>
with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim — for it is an<br>
abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery<br>
to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives —<br>
is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.<br>
Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs<br>
over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power,<br>
but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their<br>
belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are<br>
then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending<br>
to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have<br>
reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position<br>
of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group<br>
splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle<br>
begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily<br>
successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that<br>
throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today,<br>
in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he<br>
was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners,<br>
no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.<br>
From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much<br>
more than a change in the name of their masters.<br>
By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become<br>
obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted<br>
history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalter-<br>
able law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents,<br>
but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant<br>
change. In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the<br>
doctrine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats<br>
and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it<br>
had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world<br>
beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had al-<br>
ways made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however,<br>
the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not<br>
yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the<br>
past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then<br>
had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The<br>
new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socialism,<br>
a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link<br>
in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was<br>
118</p>
<p>still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of So-<br>
cialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty<br>
and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which<br>
appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism<br>
in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the con-<br>
scious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality. These new movements,<br>
of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-<br>
service to their ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress<br>
and freeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to<br>
happen once more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out<br>
by the Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious<br>
strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.<br>
The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical<br>
knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed<br>
before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now in-<br>
telligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable.<br>
But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the<br>
twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still<br>
true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had<br>
to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but<br>
there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences<br>
of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but<br>
desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of ma-<br>
chine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary<br>
for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for<br>
them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from the point of<br>
view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality<br>
was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more<br>
primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had<br>
been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an earthly paradise in which men<br>
should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute<br>
labour, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. And this<br>
vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each<br>
historical change. The heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions<br>
had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of<br>
speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their con-<br>
duct to be influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of<br>
the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authori-<br>
tarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when<br>
it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called<br>
itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening<br>
of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long aban-<br>
doned, in some cases for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the<br>
use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions,<br>
the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations-not only became<br>
common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered<br>
themselves enlightened and progressive.<br>
It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and<br>
counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged<br>
as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the<br>
119</p>
<p>various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in<br>
the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the<br>
prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What kind of people would control this<br>
world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up for the most<br>
part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity<br>
experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These<br>
people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of<br>
the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world<br>
of monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their<br>
opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury,<br>
hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing<br>
and more intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By<br>
comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-<br>
hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent<br>
by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only<br>
the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even<br>
the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part<br>
of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep<br>
its citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however, made<br>
it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the<br>
process further. With the development of television, and the technical advance<br>
which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same<br>
instrument, private life came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen<br>
important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twentyfour hours a<br>
day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all<br>
other channels of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only<br>
complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion<br>
on all subjects, now existed for the first time.<br>
After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped<br>
itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all<br>
its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard<br>
its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy<br>
is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are<br>
possessed jointly. The so-called ’abolition of private property’ which took place<br>
in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property<br>
in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners<br>
were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the<br>
Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party<br>
owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the<br>
products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step<br>
into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was<br>
represented as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the<br>
capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably<br>
the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses, transport<br>
— everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no<br>
longer private property, it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc,<br>
which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology,<br>
has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the<br>
result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been<br>
made permanent.<br>
120But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this.<br>
There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either<br>
it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are<br>
stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come<br>
into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These<br>
causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some<br>
degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in<br>
power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of<br>
the ruling class itself.<br>
After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality dis-<br>
appeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact<br>
unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic<br>
changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second<br>
danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own<br>
accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so<br>
long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never<br>
even become aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of<br>
past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but<br>
other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political<br>
results, because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate. As<br>
fcr the problem of overproduction, which has been latent in our society since<br>
the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous<br>
warfare (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the<br>
necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only<br>
genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, under-employed,<br>
power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own<br>
ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem of continu-<br>
ously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger<br>
executive group that lies immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses<br>
needs only to be influenced in a negative way.<br>
Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,<br>
the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes<br>
Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every<br>
achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom,<br>
all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and in-<br>
spiration. Nobody has ever seen Big Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a<br>
voice on the telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and<br>
there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is<br>
the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function<br>
is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are<br>
more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization. Below Big<br>
Brother comes the Inner Party. its numbers limited to six millions, or something<br>
less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes<br>
the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State,<br>
may be justly likened to the hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom<br>
we habitually refer to as ’the proles’, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the<br>
population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for<br>
the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror<br>
to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.<br>
In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The child<br>
121of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party. Admission to<br>
either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor<br>
is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province<br>
by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be<br>
found in the highest ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area<br>
are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania<br>
do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled<br>
from a distant capital. Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person<br>
whose whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief lingua franca<br>
and Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers<br>
are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine.<br>
It is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at<br>
first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to- and-fro movement<br>
between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre-<br>
industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount<br>
of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded<br>
from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made<br>
harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed<br>
to graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly<br>
become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police<br>
and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it<br>
a matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It<br>
does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there<br>
were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly<br>
prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat.<br>
In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a<br>
great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist, who had been<br>
trained to fight against something called ’class privilege’ assumed that what<br>
is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of<br>
an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary<br>
aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such<br>
as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of<br>
years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the<br>
persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead<br>
upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate<br>
its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but<br>
with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, provided that the<br>
hierarchical structure remains always the same.<br>
All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize<br>
our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent<br>
the true nature of present-day society from being perceived. Physical rebellion,<br>
or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not possible. From the<br>
proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from<br>
generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and<br>
dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping<br>
that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous<br>
if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more<br>
highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the<br>
level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold,<br>
or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted<br>
122intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the<br>
other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant<br>
subject can be tolerated.<br>
A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought<br>
Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone. Wher-<br>
ever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he<br>
can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being in-<br>
spected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his relaxations,<br>
his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when<br>
he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements<br>
of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour,<br>
but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous man-<br>
nerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to<br>
be detected. He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On the<br>
other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated<br>
code of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law. Thoughts and actions which,<br>
when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless<br>
purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as<br>
punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the<br>
wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the<br>
future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the<br>
right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never<br>
plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions<br>
inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak a good-<br>
thinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is<br>
the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental<br>
training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words<br>
crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to<br>
think too deeply on any subject whatever.<br>
A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from<br>
enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign<br>
enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before<br>
the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare,<br>
unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices<br>
as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a<br>
sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner<br>
discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught<br>
even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means<br>
the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any<br>
dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing<br>
to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they<br>
are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought<br>
which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means<br>
protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy<br>
in the full sense demands a control over one’s own mental processes as complete<br>
as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the<br>
belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since<br>
in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is<br>
need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.<br>
The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has<br>
123two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the<br>
habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain<br>
facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black<br>
is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to<br>
believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget<br>
that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration<br>
of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all<br>
the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.<br>
The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is sub-<br>
sidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party<br>
member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because<br>
he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as<br>
he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to<br>
believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of<br>
material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason<br>
for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the<br>
Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must<br>
be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the<br>
Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political<br>
alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one’s mind, or even one’s policy,<br>
is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it<br>
may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the en-<br>
emy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus history<br>
is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out<br>
by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the<br>
work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.<br>
The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is<br>
argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in<br>
human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree<br>
upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full<br>
control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party<br>
chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has<br>
been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever<br>
shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different<br>
past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the<br>
same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a<br>
year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the<br>
absolute can never have been different from what it is now. It will be seen that<br>
the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To make<br>
sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely<br>
a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened<br>
in the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one’s memories or to<br>
tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done<br>
so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique.<br>
It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are<br>
intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ’reality<br>
control’. In Newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises<br>
much else as well.<br>
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s<br>
mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows<br>
124in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is<br>
playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies<br>
himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would<br>
not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious,<br>
or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink<br>
lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use<br>
conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with com-<br>
plete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget<br>
any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary<br>
again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny<br>
the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality<br>
which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word<br>
doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one<br>
admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one<br>
erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead<br>
of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been<br>
able — and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years —<br>
to arrest the course of history.<br>
All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or be-<br>
cause they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust<br>
themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became<br>
liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and<br>
once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either through conscious-<br>
ness or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to have<br>
produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultane-<br>
ously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be<br>
made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to<br>
dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief<br>
in one’s own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.<br>
It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those<br>
who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating.<br>
In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also<br>
those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. In general, the greater the<br>
understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One<br>
clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one<br>
rises in the social scale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly<br>
rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the<br>
war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies<br>
like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to<br>
them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will<br>
be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same<br>
manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured workers whom we call ’the<br>
proles’ are only intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary they<br>
can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they<br>
are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is in the<br>
ranks of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm<br>
is found. World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to<br>
be impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites — knowledge with<br>
ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism-is one of the chief distinguishing marks of<br>
Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even when<br>
125there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every<br>
principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to<br>
do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working class<br>
unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which<br>
was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. It<br>
systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a<br>
name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names<br>
of the four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in<br>
their deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with<br>
war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the<br>
Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental,<br>
nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in<br>
doublethink. For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be<br>
retained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If<br>
human equality is to be for ever averted — if the High, as we have called them,<br>
are to keep their places permanently — then the prevailing mental condition<br>
must be controlled insanity.<br>
But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored.<br>
It is; why should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics<br>
of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this huge,<br>
accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time?<br>
Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of the<br>
Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon doublethink. But deeper<br>
than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led to<br>
the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the Thought Police, continuous<br>
warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards.<br>
This motive really consists &#8230;</p>
<p>Chapter III p.109 &#8211;<br>
War is Peace<br>
The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event<br>
which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth<br>
century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by<br>
the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were<br>
already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct<br>
unit after another decade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three<br>
super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according<br>
to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia<br>
comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-<br>
mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the<br>
Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion<br>
of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western<br>
frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese<br>
islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.<br>
In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently<br>
at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is<br>
no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades<br>
of the twentieth centary. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants<br>
who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and<br>
are not divided by any genuine ideological difference. This is not to say that<br>
either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less<br>
bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous<br>
and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter<br>
of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against<br>
prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as<br>
normal, and, when they are committed by one’s own side and not by the enemy,<br>
meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people,<br>
mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties. The<br>
fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts<br>
the average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses which<br>
guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the centres of civilization war means<br>
no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional<br>
109crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact<br>
changed its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have<br>
changed in their order of importance. Motives which were already present to<br>
some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth centuary have now<br>
become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.<br>
To understand the nature of the present war — for in spite of the regrouping<br>
which occurs every few years, it is always the same war — one must realize in<br>
the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-<br>
states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination.<br>
They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable.<br>
Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. Oceania by the width of the At-<br>
lantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its in-<br>
habitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight<br>
about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production<br>
and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was<br>
a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw<br>
materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three<br>
super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs<br>
within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose,<br>
it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not<br>
permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral<br>
with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing<br>
within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession<br>
of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three<br>
powers are constantly struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the<br>
whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and<br>
it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery<br>
that dictates the endless changes of alignment.<br>
All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them<br>
yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it<br>
is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above all<br>
they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls<br>
equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or Southern India, or<br>
the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds<br>
of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these ar-<br>
eas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from<br>
conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race<br>
to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour<br>
power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefi-<br>
nitely. It should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges<br>
of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the<br>
basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of<br>
the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured<br>
by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and<br>
Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous<br>
territories which in fact are largely unihabited and unexplored: but the bal-<br>
ance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the<br>
heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate. Moreover, the labour of<br>
the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world’s<br>
economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they<br>
110</p>
<p>produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always<br>
to be in a better position in which to wage another war. By their labour the<br>
slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But<br>
if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it<br>
maintains itself, would not be essentially different.<br>
The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of<br>
doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the<br>
directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine<br>
without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nine-<br>
teenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods<br>
has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even<br>
have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have<br>
become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The<br>
world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that<br>
existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to<br>
which the people of that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century,<br>
the vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient<br>
— a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete —<br>
was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and tech-<br>
nology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume<br>
that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the<br>
impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because<br>
scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought,<br>
which could not survive in a strictly regimented society. As a whole the world<br>
is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas<br>
have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare<br>
and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have<br>
largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have<br>
never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are<br>
still there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was<br>
clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to<br>
a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used<br>
deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be<br>
eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any<br>
such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which<br>
it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living<br>
standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty<br>
years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.<br>
But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the<br>
destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical<br>
society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat,<br>
lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car<br>
or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form<br>
of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth<br>
would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society<br>
in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be<br>
evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged<br>
caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure<br>
and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who<br>
are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to<br>
111</p>
<p>think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner<br>
or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would<br>
sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on<br>
a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as some<br>
thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not<br>
a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization<br>
which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and<br>
moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in<br>
a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its<br>
more advanced rivals.<br>
Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting<br>
the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase<br>
of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries<br>
was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was<br>
not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and<br>
kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and<br>
since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition<br>
inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without<br>
increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they<br>
must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by<br>
continuous warfare.<br>
The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of<br>
the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring<br>
into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might<br>
otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long<br>
run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed,<br>
their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without<br>
producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example,<br>
has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships.<br>
Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit<br>
to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is<br>
built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus<br>
that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the<br>
needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there<br>
is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an<br>
advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere<br>
near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the<br>
importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one<br>
group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a<br>
member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless,<br>
the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better<br>
texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his<br>
two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter — set him in a different<br>
world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party<br>
have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we<br>
call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the<br>
possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and<br>
poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore<br>
in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural,<br>
unavoidable condition of survival.<br>
112</p>
<p>War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accom-<br>
plishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite<br>
simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyra-<br>
mids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast<br>
quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only<br>
the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is<br>
concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so<br>
long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even<br>
the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even<br>
intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a<br>
credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adula-<br>
tion, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have<br>
the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the<br>
war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not<br>
matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state<br>
of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires<br>
of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is<br>
now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it<br>
becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the<br>
enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary<br>
for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is<br>
untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is ei-<br>
ther not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared<br>
ones: but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink.<br>
Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief<br>
that the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania the<br>
undisputed master of the entire world.<br>
All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article<br>
of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more ter-<br>
ritory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the<br>
discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons<br>
continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which<br>
the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the<br>
present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak<br>
there is no word for ’Science’. The empirical method of thought, on which all<br>
the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most<br>
fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological progress only hap-<br>
pens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human<br>
liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going back-<br>
wards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by<br>
machinery. But in matters of vital importance — meaning, in effect, war and<br>
police espionage — the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least toler-<br>
ated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth<br>
and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There<br>
are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is<br>
how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and<br>
the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without<br>
giving warning beforehand. In so far as scientific research still continues, this<br>
is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist<br>
and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial<br>
113</p>
<p>expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing ef-<br>
fects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,<br>
physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject<br>
as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of<br>
Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the<br>
Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are<br>
indefatigably at work. Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics<br>
of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more<br>
powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour- plating; others<br>
search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being pro-<br>
duced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for<br>
breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive<br>
to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine<br>
under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;<br>
others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun’s rays through<br>
lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial<br>
earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth’s centre.<br>
But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none<br>
of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others. What is<br>
more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb,<br>
a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to<br>
discover. Although the Party, according to its habit, claims the invention for<br>
itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were<br>
first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that time some hundreds of<br>
bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western<br>
Europe, and North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of<br>
all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized<br>
society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal agree-<br>
ment was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three<br>
powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against<br>
the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. And<br>
meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty<br>
years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have<br>
been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable<br>
battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but other-<br>
wise there has been little development. The tank, the submarine, the torpedo,<br>
the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use. And<br>
in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens,<br>
the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even<br>
millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated.<br>
None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves<br>
the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is usually<br>
a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers are follow-<br>
ing, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same. The plan is,<br>
by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to<br>
acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and<br>
then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms<br>
for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded<br>
with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will<br>
all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation<br>
114</p>
<p>impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remain-<br>
ing world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is hardly<br>
necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover, no<br>
fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the<br>
Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact<br>
that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. Eurasia,<br>
for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically<br>
part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push<br>
its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the<br>
principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If<br>
Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and<br>
Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of<br>
great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million<br>
people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic<br>
level. The problem is the same for all three super-states. It is absolutely neces-<br>
sary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except,<br>
to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the official<br>
ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners<br>
apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eura-<br>
sia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he<br>
were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures<br>
similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.<br>
The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and<br>
self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore<br>
realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon<br>
may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except<br>
bombs.<br>
Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and<br>
acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very<br>
much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia<br>
it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usu-<br>
ally translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration<br>
of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets<br>
of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous<br>
outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually the three philosophies<br>
are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not<br>
distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the<br>
same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for con-<br>
tinuous warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer<br>
one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so<br>
long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of<br>
corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously<br>
aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world<br>
conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue<br>
everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the fact that there is no danger<br>
of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of<br>
Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has<br>
been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed<br>
its character.<br>
In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later<br>
115</p>
<p>came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the past, also,<br>
war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in<br>
touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false<br>
view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage<br>
any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency. So long as defeat meant<br>
the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable,<br>
the precautions against defeat had to be serious. Physical facts could not be<br>
ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might<br>
make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make<br>
four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle<br>
for efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary<br>
to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of<br>
what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course,<br>
always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today<br>
would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far<br>
as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all<br>
safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely<br>
irresponsible.<br>
But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.<br>
When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. Technical<br>
progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. As<br>
we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for<br>
the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their<br>
failure to show results is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency, is<br>
no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police.<br>
Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate<br>
universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised.<br>
Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life — the need<br>
to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or<br>
stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and<br>
between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that<br>
is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen<br>
of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which<br>
direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as<br>
the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their<br>
followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient,<br>
and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as<br>
their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into<br>
whatever shape they choose.<br>
The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is<br>
merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals<br>
whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one<br>
another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of<br>
consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a<br>
hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In<br>
the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their<br>
common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against<br>
one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day<br>
they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each<br>
ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make<br>
116</p>
<p>or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact.<br>
The very word ’war’, therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be<br>
accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The<br>
peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age<br>
and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something<br>
quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states,<br>
instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each<br>
inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a<br>
self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external<br>
danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent<br>
war. This — although the vast majority of Party members understand it only<br>
in a shallower sense — is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: War is Peace.</p>
<p>117.</p>
<p>He understood<br>
how; he did not understand why. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actu-<br>
ally told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the<br>
knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew better than<br>
before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did<br>
not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung<br>
to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.</p>

<p>of labor mean only a tran­sitional regime whose destiny history</p>
<p>has not yet finally weighed.<br>
&#8220;Is it not monstrous ?&#8217;�-we wrote in March 193�. &#8220;The<br>
country can not get out of a famine of goods. There is a<br>
stoppage of supplies at every step. Children lack milk.</p>
<p>But the official oracles announce : &#8216;The country has entered<br>
into the period of socialism !&#8217; Would it be possible more<br>
viciously to compromise the name of socialism ?&#8221; Karl<br>
Radek, now . a prominent publicist- of the ruling Soviet<br>
circles, parried these remarks in the German liberal paper,<br>
Berliner Tageblatt, in a special issue devoted to the Soviet<br>
Union (May 1932) , in the following words which deserve<br>
to be immortal :</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Milk is a product of cows and not of<br>
socialism, and you would have actually to confuse socialism<br>
with the image of a country where rivers flow milk, in<br>
order not to understand that a country can rise for a time<br>
to a higher level of development without any considerable<br>
rise in the material situation of the popular masses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These lines were written when a horrible famine was raging in the<br>
country.<br>
Socialism is a structure of planned production to the<br>
end of the best satisfaction of human needs ; otherwise it<br>
does not deserve the name of socialism. If cows are</p>
<p>social­ized, but there are too few of them, or they have</p>
<p>too meager udders, then conflicts arise out of the inadequate<br>
supply of milk-conflicts between city and country, be­<br>
tween collectives and individual peasants, between dif­<br>
ferent strata of the proletariat, between the whole toiling<br>
mass and the bureaucracy.<br>

<p>Internal Predictor of the USSR:<br>
explanation of the terminology used<br>
The term “predictor-corrector” originates from calculus mathematics, where it names the whole group of<br>
methods. In them the solution is found with successive approximations. The algorithm represents a cycle with<br>
two consequent operations executed: the first one is the solution prediction and the second is checking if the<br>
predicted solution satisfies the problem accuracy requirement. The algorithm comes to its end when the predic-<br>
tion satisfies the accuracy requirement.<br>
Moreover, the scheme of ruling, in which the ruling signal is formed using the prognosis of the future sys-<br>
tem behaviour as well as the information of its present state, is also sometimes called “predictor-corrector”<br>
(though it is possibly more right to call it “predirector-corrector” – it directs the way in advance). With the<br>
scheme of “predictor-corrector” the highest quality of ruling is provided since the part of information circuits<br>
is completed through the predicted future but not through the accomplished past. This fact allows to reduce the<br>
lateness of ruling relative to the perturbation action to zero; and to use the forestalling ruling, (where the rul-<br>
ing action forestalls the cause that forces ruling), if it is needed. Considering different conflicts, from the view<br>
of the theory of ruling the scheme of predictor corrector often excludes even a possibility to strive with the sys-<br>
tem using it in advance.<br>
So, the term “predictor-corrector” is widely known among mathematicians and technicians in the West.<br>
As it follows from the history, the predictor-corrector scheme was used for ruling the social systems even in<br>
the ancient times. The superior zhrechestvo 1 of the ancient Egypt was called “hierophants”, which meant their<br>
ability to read the fate (i.e. the matrix of possible states), to foresee the future. The last one is the basis of any<br>
ruling, since to rule a system (here: a society) is to lead it to the chosen certain variant from many possible<br>
ones on the basis of knowing these possible states. It’s naturally that choosing the variant depends on the real<br>
morality and will of those, who have achieved the foresight and ruling on its base.<br>
The Russian word “жрец” (“zhrets”) is a composed word as many other ancient Russian words. The letter<br>
Ж (Zh – is read as French ‘j’) means the word ЖИЗНЬ (Life); and the word РЕЦ means “the one who<br>
speaks”. “Жречество” (“zhrechestvo”) means something like a community of zhretses; the suffix ‘-stvo’ re-<br>
fers to the English suffix ‘-hood’ like in “brotherhood”, or to ‘-ship’ as in “friendship”; and the stem variation<br>
is widely used in Russian, so ‘ts’ (is read as German ‘z’) in zhrets turns to ‘ch’ in zhrechestvo with adding a<br>
suffix. Thus zhrets can be understood as he who speaks about the Life (the Life in its whole sense, about the<br>
Life of men, of the mankind and the Humanity, of Cosmos the whole Universe, and of God), and zhrechestvo<br>
speaks about the Life for the Good of the society.<br>
In English there is a word “a priest” which is usually translated into Russian as “zhrets”, but it is not right,<br>
since “a priest” is an adherent of a certain confession, church or pagan beliefs, a pope, a clergyman etc. We<br>
will use it in such sense. The nearest analogue to the word “zhrets” in English is the word “soothsayer”, but<br>
understood not as “a foreteller” or “a fortune-teller”, but as “he who tells (and speaks) the sooth (the truth)<br>
”. We will use the word zhrets using this Latin transliteration.<br>
Жречество занято жизнеречением 2 во благо общества.<br>
Zhrechestvo speaks about the Life for the Good of the society.<br>
The phonetics, the lexical and conceptual systems of Russian language are rather special. This phrase can-<br>
not be translated into other languages without loosing many sides of sense and many associative relations. So<br>
the term “predictor-corrector” was introduced for better understanding of this and for using in English. How-<br>
ever, today we introduce the word zhrets to English and will use it.<br>
It is useful for an English speaking reader to learn Russian language to understand many particular features<br>
of its root, lexical, conceptual systems. We translate many works into English today, but it is sometimes im-<br>
possible to translate all meanings of the word and all its relatives! Moreover, “to translate” means “to find a<br>
word in another language for the same thing, for the same image”. But how can one translate the concept, if<br>
there are no images in another language, no such things at all! Thus one should do not “a trans-lation” but “in-<br>
tro-lation” (introduction, intromission). So we “introlate” the word zhrets. And also we introlate another word:<br>
знахарь “znakhar”.<br>
“Znakhar” (‘kh’ is a single consonant as Scottish ‘ch’ in “loch”) originates from the verb “знать” (“to<br>
know”), which is very close to the word “значить” (“to mean”, “to sign”); the suffix ‘-арь’ (‘-ar’) refers to<br>
the Latin suffix (‘-ist’), so znakhar is “he who knows”, who has some knowledge but doesn’t<br>
share it with people.<br>
1<br>
Read a bit forward<br>
The suffix ‘-ен’ refers to English ‘-ing’ meaning an action named with the previous verb. So “речь” (verb is “ре-<br>
кать” though today it is used not without different prefixes) – turns into “речение” and in English can be found as<br>
“speaking” (but not in its modern usual meaning) like an action when one speaks.<br>
2Today in Russian all the words with such meaning: “ведун”, “ведьма” (from “ведать”=“to know” 1 ), “зна-<br>
харь” means something like “a witch”, “a quack doctor”. But it doesn’t mean that one cannot understand the<br>
word in its literal meaning. And in literal meaning the word znakhar means only “he who knows ”.<br>
Zhretses with their foresight, knowledge, words in advance lead the course of life of society to an absence<br>
of poverty and to the well-structured and comfortable state, with all this keeping the society in harmony with<br>
the Earth biosphere, the Cosmos and the God.<br>
Znakhars are self-interested while exploiting the society on the basis of their knowledge, and they wittingly<br>
cultivate the ignorance and perverted knowledge in the society exploited.<br>
And this is the difference between zhrechestvo and znakharstvo.<br>
The harmony of society, its culture and Earth biosphere needs the global level of responsibility and of<br>
CARENESS about the well-being (not only a material one) of all nations on the Earth. English is today the<br>
most popular for international communication. So we take care of that you, English speakers, understand that<br>
what we want to say you but not what the masters of “false horses of enlightenment” 2 want to give you as our<br>
opinion.<br>
Russians don’t need such words as “conception” – we have the word “жизнестрой” (“Life organization”),<br>
and English can also find some its old roots to avoid the dead Latin.<br>
Our opponents must understand that their monopoly on the knowledge is over. Using imagery: We<br>
pour our “spring water” into their “old wine-skins” for their “skins” split: we don’t like their “skins”<br>
and their stupefying narcotic “wine”.</p>
<h1>“Translators – are false horses of enlightenment” Pushkin</h1>
<p>My dear Watson, – he said at last, – don’t you think, that certain things in life are not worth learning?<br>
Was not it you, who once quoted for me some astonishing saying of the Great Russian poet Pushkin: «</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>&#8220;A fiction that elevates my soul is dearer to me than a host of base and despicable truths”. Pushkin</h1>
