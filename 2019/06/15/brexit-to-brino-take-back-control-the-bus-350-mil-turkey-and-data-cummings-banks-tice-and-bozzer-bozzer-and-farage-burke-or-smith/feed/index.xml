Hi Don,
“Climate Change is Real” is The Sky is Blue, does the pope wear a funny hat?
Is CO2 the control Knob for Global Warming?, This is a very different question.

What is the crisis? I think Dennis Rancourt is correct in the following thesis that the crisis is a crisis in Dollar Hegemony and a lot of the rest is a result of the old Binary choice of Guns or Butter.

https://culturalanalysis.net/2019/06/16/historical-emergence-of-climate-change-gender-equity-and-anti-racism-as-state-doctrines-denis-g-rancourt/

Historical emergence of climate change, gender equity, and anti-racism as State doctrines. (Denis G. Rancourt)

This is a lightly edited, highly abridged version of a recent paper by Denis G. Rancourt; possibly the most important piece of political research of the last half-century.

During the Bretton Woods period, from 1945 to 1971, the USA experienced a growing deterioration of its preeminence as the main trade-surplus nation, and projected a difficulty in honouring the gold redeeming arrangement if confidence in the USA dollar were to falter. “On August 15, 1971, without prior warning to the leaders of the other major capitalist powers, US president Nixon announced in a Sunday evening televised address to the nation that the US was [unilaterally] removing the gold backing from the dollar.” Unlocking the dollar from gold freed the USA to print as much money as it wanted, and to disregard any trade deficit (or “debt”) that it might accumulate, as long as the dollar kept its place as the de facto world currency.

Nafeez Ahmed article is interesting to Read, In that, he is definitely one of the Commissars of the New Green Fascism. As with Kremlin watching of old Nafeez spins the UN Watch eugenics and genocidal Agenda ( 21, 30)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael,
My go to for the framework on Climate Science is Geoffrey Glassmans Rocket Scientist Journal.
http://rocketscientistsjournal.com/

I matched the Slide Show to this Glassman Talk on Modelling and Mathematical Scientific Models
https://www.bitchute.com/video/dv8avoovsHqr/
Thanks for the Links.

Are you familiar with this Classic Paper? 

https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0707/0707.1161v4.pdf

I am also a Keen Student of Claes Johnsons WOrk.
https://claesjohnson.blogspot.com/2013/11/standard-calculus-as-ill-posed-unstable.html

The Admiral Titley Michael Mann Double Act in the Shilman Law debate with Curry and Moore is something to behold and indicates the Deep State requirement for the Carbon Emissions Manichean red under the bed Myth. 

https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/admiral-titleys-whopper-wheres-the-beef-in-the-hansen-feint-climate-debate-of-the-decade-mann-titley-curry-and-moore-textual-analysis/

Clive Spashes Paper on The Brave new world of Carbon trading is an important Context piece in the Jigsaw puzzle of CLimate religio/politics, Rancourts work is very important on this.

The first link will work if you copy the Entire string including “.pdf”, like this: “droyer.web.wesleyan.edu/PhanCO2(GCA).pdf”

Here’s another paper I just came across which you will find interesting, showing 9-12 moths lag of CO2 AFTER increases in Temperature over the last 40 years. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818112001658

Best wishes, Michael]]></description>

Hi The first link does not work, the Todhunter interview with Dennis Rancourt is very good
The Graph on the  RWER blog is an absurdity, I was surprised to see it and felt compelled to comment.
Thanks for the links if you could send a working one for the PDF link I would be Grateful-
Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Roger, I am now consistently blocked by RWER blog from commenting but wanted to share with you couple of interesting items related to the recent, provably false, CO2 history graph posted by the editor. This was my attempted reply to the post (censored):

“This chart is simply wrong. No serious climate scientist would dare to deny validity of the existing CO2 record based on well established geological proxies. A simple google search of academic literature on the subject would reveal that much. Here is just one example: http://droyer.web.wesleyan.edu/PhanCO2(GCA).pdf”

And here is discussion of a great paper and an interview with the author in Counterpunch about the reasons why “climate emergency” and other irrational social movements are promoted by the elites: https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/06/13/from-dollar-hegemony-to-global-warming-globalization-glyphosate-and-doctrines-of-consent/]]></description>
