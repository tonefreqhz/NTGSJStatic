Consider this,

(a curiously neglected fact) Western governments have been mak-

ing more money from oil than OPEC. In 2014, taxes in G7 countries

accounted for about 47% of the price of a liter of oil, compared to about

39% going to the producers, with the respective national shares at 60/30 in

the UK, 52/34 in Germany, and 15/61 in the United States (OPEC 2015).

 Ayres, Ayres, and Warr (2003) identified the declining price of useful
work as the growth engine of the U.S. economy during the twentieth cen-
tury, useful work being the product of exergy (the maximum work possible
in an ideal energy conversion process) and conversion efficiency. Once the
historical data of economic output are normalized (with GDP values
expressed in constant, inflation-adjusted monies and with the national
products used to calculate GWP given in terms of purchasing power parity
rather than by using official exchange rates), impressively strong long-term
correlations between economic growth and energy use emerge on both
global and national levels.

Mass extinctions, and other bed wetting memes Don are just the outpourings of feeble-minded or corrupted camp followers of a hopelessly degraded system of governance at all levels of Civic and commercial society.

There are problems most of which stem from poor governance and extremely asymmetric priorities The Lunatics have taken over the Asylum and bed wetting adolescents are being held up as paragons of wisdom for spouting aphorisms, platitudes and Doing their homework on a self-imposed 4 day week.

Seeds is but part of the solution which is still hampered by the age-old problem of still being invested in the old paradigm

A MONETARY CASE FOR VALUE-ADDED NEGATIVE TAX MICHAEL KOWALIK [TOOLANGI, AUSTRALIA]

Abstract I address the most fundamental yet routinely ignored issue in economics today: that of distributive impact of the monetary system on the real economy. By re-examining the logical implications of token re-presentation of value and Irving Fisher’s theory of exchange, I argue that producers of value incur incidental expropriation of wealth associated with the deflationary effect that new value supply has on the purchasing power of money. In order to remedy the alleged inequity I propose a value-added negative tax (VANT) based on net individual contribution to the economic output, which is structured as a negative tax function geared to profits derived from eligible productive activities in consideration of their estimated deflationary impact. I show that an adequately optimised VANT can be non-inflationary and have zero net cost to the public. Furthermore, economic output stands to improve due to direct incentivisation of value creation, making the proposed scheme not only politically feasible but economically desirable. The proposal advances the principle of ‘fair money’, where all forms of economic value are attributed to their rightful owners prior to any positive taxation.

OF MONEY AND WHY ABSTRACT CURRENCIES FAIL — A CRITICAL REVIEW
Go to the profile of Wesley Freeburg
Wesley Freeburg
Jan 1, 2018
INTRODUCTION
An article published by Roy Sebag (“RS”) this past March with the above captioned title was recently brought to my attention in the course of an interesting “conversation” on Twitter, which actually included a well-known anthropologist, some crypto people, and some “gold-bugs” inter alia. In this essay, my first on Medium, I shall argue RS fails to properly describe “the Natural Order of Money” with an undisguised attempt to perpetuate a long-ago discredited “intrinsic” value theory.

https://medium.com/@wesfree/the-natural-order-of-money-and-why-abstract-currencies-fail-a-critical-review-e05f928fb64c

Nature is much more robust than the ego of Psychopathic Elites and their academy of sycophants would have us all believe.
They may push the Button and Nuclear Holocaust may do for us, that or a Large Interstellar comet&#038;asteroid incident or some sort of Carrington event.

On the Nuclear Button problem, I like Roger Fishers solution best.
https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/trident-the-nuclear-codes-and-skin-in-the-game/
My suggestion was quite simple: Put that needed code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, “George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.” He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.
When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, “My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.“
— Roger Fisher, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, March 1981[10]]]></description>

<p>Mass extinctions, and other bed wetting memes Don are just the outpourings of feeble-minded or corrupted camp followers of a hopelessly degraded system of governance at all levels of Civic and commercial society.</p>
<p>There are problems most of which stem from poor governance and extremely asymmetric priorities The Lunatics have taken over the Asylum and bed wetting adolescents are being held up as paragons of wisdom for spouting aphorisms, platitudes and Doing their homework on a self-imposed 4 day week.</p>
<p>Seeds is but part of the solution which is still hampered by the age-old problem of still being invested in the old paradigm<br />

<p>A MONETARY CASE FOR VALUE-ADDED NEGATIVE TAX MICHAEL KOWALIK [TOOLANGI, AUSTRALIA]</p>
<p>Abstract I address the most fundamental yet routinely ignored issue in economics today: that of distributive impact of the monetary system on the real economy. By re-examining the logical implications of token re-presentation of value and Irving Fisher’s theory of exchange, I argue that producers of value incur incidental expropriation of wealth associated with the deflationary effect that new value supply has on the purchasing power of money. In order to remedy the alleged inequity I propose a value-added negative tax (VANT) based on net individual contribution to the economic output, which is structured as a negative tax function geared to profits derived from eligible productive activities in consideration of their estimated deflationary impact. I show that an adequately optimised VANT can be non-inflationary and have zero net cost to the public. Furthermore, economic output stands to improve due to direct incentivisation of value creation, making the proposed scheme not only politically feasible but economically desirable. The proposal advances the principle of ‘fair money’, where all forms of economic value are attributed to their rightful owners prior to any positive taxation.

<p>OF MONEY AND WHY ABSTRACT CURRENCIES FAIL — A CRITICAL REVIEW<br />
Go to the profile of Wesley Freeburg<br />

INTRODUCTION<br />
An article published by Roy Sebag (“RS”) this past March with the above captioned title was recently brought to my attention in the course of an interesting “conversation” on Twitter, which actually included a well-known anthropologist, some crypto people, and some “gold-bugs” inter alia. In this essay, my first on Medium, I shall argue RS fails to properly describe “the Natural Order of Money” with an undisguised attempt to perpetuate a long-ago discredited “intrinsic” value theory.</p>

<p>Nature is much more robust than the ego of Psychopathic Elites and their academy of sycophants would have us all believe.<br />
They may push the Button and Nuclear Holocaust may do for us, that or a Large Interstellar comet&amp;asteroid incident or some sort of Carrington event.</p>
<p>On the Nuclear Button problem, I like Roger Fishers solution best.<br />
<a href="https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/trident-the-nuclear-codes-and-skin-in-the-game/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/trident-the-nuclear-codes-and-skin-in-the-game/</a><br />
My suggestion was quite simple: Put that needed code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, “George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.” He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.<br />
When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, “My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.“<br />
— Roger Fisher, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, March 1981[10]</p>

@Roger Lewis and All
Is CO2 the knob? It’s one knob. Another is the disrupted water cycle. The water cycle is far larger than the CO2 cycle in terms of influence on climate, both globally and locally. Walter Jehne is trying to bring attention to the water cycle and point us in the direction of what we can do about it. The Call of the Reed Warbler by the Australian farmer Charles Massy discusses Jehne’s evidence in some detail, and gives examples of farmers who are doing something about it. In order to influence the water cycle, one must also influence carbon in the soil, which, of course, is carbon that doesn’t go into the air or seas as carbon dioxide.

But there are multiple systems which are currently threatening humanity and prompting a Sixth Mass Extinction. And, of course, the falling quality of fossil fuels threatens humanity, but not the rest of life, at least directly. A new paper gives a good look at the prospects for ‘life after fossil fuels’. You can find a synopsis by searching on:

Geo-cultural Time: Advancing Human Societal Complexity Within Worldwide Constraint Bottlenecks—A Chronological/Helical Approach to Understanding Human–Planetary Interactions 
The full text has been copied onto Gail Tverberg’s site, which you can find by looking in the comments section of her current post. Or you can purchase the article for around 40 dollars from Springer.

Briefly, the study warns about all sorts of dysfunctional behavior ending in the survivors living in the equivalent of neolithic villages. But you should read their words for yourself. The article describes our current economic system as dysfunctional in terms of human survival.
