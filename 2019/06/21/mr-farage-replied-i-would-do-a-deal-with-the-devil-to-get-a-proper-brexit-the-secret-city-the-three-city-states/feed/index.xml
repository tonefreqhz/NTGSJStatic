					<description><![CDATA[Observations on Credit and Surveillance
by @matthewstoller.
NAFTA Origins, Part One: The Original NAFTA Included Great Britain
I’m going to do a series on the origins of NAFTA, because it’s a weird ride that took happened over several decades.This hearing, in a 1967 discussion of what to do after the completion of a significant round of global tariff reductions, is the first place where NAFTA is mentioned in the Congressional record. Only, it is mentioned by Kenneth Younger, a British scholar, ex-intelligence official, and ex-MP. Younger speaks about NAFTA in the context of Britain choosing between the nascent European Union and a North Atlantic equivalent. Yes, in this case, NAFTA stood for North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, not North American Free Trade Agreement. But Canada would play a big part, and Mexico was also peripherally involved, as you’ll see.

					<description><![CDATA[[Side Note: When I first started researching this subject, a young programmer committed suicide because he was replaced in his job – insult to injury, he had to train his replacement.  That story hurt my heart because Kevin was a young man who did everything right.  He made it though school.  He went to college and he got his first job as a Programmer at the Bank of America.  He loved his job and he was at the beginning of a life filled with promise – the American Dream but the corporate traitor elite blew up his life in favor of cheap, imported, commodity labor.

					<description><![CDATA[In March of 1987, William Brock was the invited speaker at a National Press Club event.  This is a very important event to watch because William Brock was the traitor – the betrayer of the American people because he initiated the Uruguay Round of trade that included putting American jobs on the global market for the lowest bidders.  (Trade in Services).   Brock said in his talk, “we’ll either have to export jobs or import people”.   And that’s precisely what they did despite all the happy horse “talk” about a bright future for the American economy.  They redesigned our schools for the bottom of intellectual pool – those who had NO CHANCE at the tech jobs of the future – while blowing up middle class through the importation of foreign workers.

					<description><![CDATA[Traitorous Trade Policy
In 1967, a hearing of the Foreign Policy Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee, chaired by Senator William Proxmire was held.  It was the beginning of a reassessment and reorientation of U.S. Trade Policy against the interests of the American people as described above.  An article written by Matthew Stoller titled, NAFTA Origins, Part One: The Original NAFTA Included Great Britain has the story and a link to the full hearing.

Aurelio Peccei was invited to testify at that hearing.  There was no mention of the fact that Aurelio Peccei’s degree was in economics and his master’s thesis was on Vladimir Lenin’s New Economic Policy.  Excerpts from Peccei’s testimony to the Committee:
