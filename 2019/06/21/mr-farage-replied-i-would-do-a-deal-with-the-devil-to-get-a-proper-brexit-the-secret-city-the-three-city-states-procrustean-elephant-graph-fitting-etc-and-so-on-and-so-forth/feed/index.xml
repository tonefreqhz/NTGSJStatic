Elites&#039; strange plot to take over the world
A few decades ago, politicians hatched a Tom Friedman-esque idea to unite U.S. and Western Europe. Did it succeed?

The strange story of Atlantica

The effort to unite Europe and the U.S. started in 1939, with the publication of a book by an influential journalist, Clarence Streit. This influential book was called &quot;Union Now,&quot; and had a galvanizing effect on the anti-fascist youth of the time, a sort of cross between Thomas Friedman’s &quot;The World Is Flat&quot; and Naomi Klein’s &quot;The Shock Doctrine.&quot; Streit served in World War I in an intelligence unit, and saw up close the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles. He then became a New York Times journalist assigned to cover the League of Nations, which led him to the conclusion that the only way to prevent American isolationism and European fascism was for political and economic integration of the major “freedom-loving” peoples, which he described as America, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and most of Western Europe. The Five Eyes surveillance architecture was created just a few years later, as was the international monetary regime concocted at Bretton Woods.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[https://moneyasdebt.wordpress.com/about/

This blog intends to point out

the fact that there are two kinds of money in circulation:
Cash, consisting of notes and coins, issued by the State
Credit, aka “central bank money”, issued by monetary and financial institutions
that there are fundamental differences between these two kinds of money
for Cash, the authority of the issuing agency is in the UK the Sovereign, i.e. The Crown or HM The Queen
“credit money” requires “interest money” that nobody issues
that the effects of interest are equally debilitating for the public and the private sector of the economy:
every interest payment requires borrowing from Peter to pay Paul
mainly the people in monetary and financial institutions benefit from interest payments
the growth of compounding interest on interest is exponential, i.e. unsustainable; see understanding exponential growth
that increasing the money supply is decreasing the value of the currency due to printing “money”
the value of “money” is deflated as the money supply is inflated willy nilly
the function of money changes from “medium of exchange” and “store of value” to “tool for control”, since debts are legally enforceable
the fact that credit becomes cash or “money”, behind the bank counter, means:
the quality conditions under which Cash is produced, the correctness of paper and printing for notes and the quality of metal for minting coins, are not applied
no quality control means absence of quality, if not counterfeiting…
the fact that governments facilitate this process of Credit becoming “money”, aka laundering, means:
by borrowing money as “national” or “public debt”, the supply of “credit money” is increased, i.e. the value of the currency is debased to the detriment of the nation
by demanding taxes to pay interest to the financial economy, the real economy is debilitated
no matter which party wins an election, governments have been perpetuating the process of borrowing more and more through the budget deficit
the trend that has led to virtually replacing Cash with credit money from 50/50 after WWII to 3% Cash in the money supply; see What is the Cash Crumble?.
The blog was inspired by a lady who wanted to spread the message about Money as Debt. She had been aware of the activities around the Forum for Stable Currencies and offered her support.

The Forum has been advocating economic democracy through freedom from national debts as the ultimate goal. But the road to economic democracy is marked by many milestones that many people can contribute.

The purpose of this blog is spelled out in our first post.

An alternative to the current system of creating money as a financial product is on the (proposed) Bank of England Act 2010.

Secret City, a documentary investigation into the City of London,the Corporation that runs it and its role in the financial crisis.

magine a city consisting of fewer than 10 thousand residents. Imagine that city’s government elected by businesses, and the bigger the business, the more votes it has. This city has funds amounting to billions of pounds, accumulated over a thousand years, which it can use at will, with no public accountability, to promote its interests around the world.

This city is London. Not the metropolis we know so much about, but the thing referred to as the “square mile” or The City. Often referred to either as an archaic but quaint and harmless relic from the past, or as a place where bankers simply do business, neither description gets close to the reality of this entity.]]></description>

Hi Matthew, I am embarking on a new Web 3 based publishing project one of the joys of which allowing myself the inestimable pleasure of reading deeper into thinking and writing which has stayed with me over the years and going back to read more form those Writers and Thinkers.
So here I am and Here it is in the proto-idea stage.
I would love to discuss Brexit with you in a Chat over Skype, and perhaps if you are Up for it as they say record it for streaming on Our New Video Portal and BitChute, BitTube and legacy Web, YouTube channels.

					<description><![CDATA[Money and the Coming World Order: The Creation of International Monetary Order
Written by Lewis E. Lehrman
Tuesday, January	04, 2011
Today, national economic policy making is largely concerned with the problems of unemployment and inflation. More precisely, it is their simultaneous combination in nearly all Western economies which preoccupies policy makers. As these problems grow worse, the stakes rise higher.

Who is Peter Thiel?
February 11th, 2011 by Edward Miller
You may have heard of Peter Thiel, the right-wing “libertarian” co-founder of Paypal and early investor in Facebook. He seems to be a magnet for controversy and intrigue, with his penchant for casual misogyny and exotic philanthropic endeavors. So, who or what is he really?

Despite his attempts to label himself a libertarian, it should be clear he is anything but. His ideology seems neoconservative or worse if you trace some of his other “philanthropy.” For instance, he gave $75,000 to the far-right Institute on Religion and Public Life, gave $25,900 to Meg Whitman’s failed gubernatorial campaign, and provided the funding to the smear group that attacked ACORN.

I wish that were all, but he has a long history of this sort of thing. What kind of libertarian funds anti-immigrant groups? All the real libertarians I know are borderline anarchists and often don’t even believe in borders. Xenophobia and libertarianism are incompatible by any sensible definitions.]]></description>

Bridging Religions and Markets: Social Monetary Interest, Not Social Credit
February 22, 2012 by Keith Gardner

The Henry George remedy was not to socialize real estate, just economic rent on land. Henry George still believed the free market should still valuate and distribute land. He just wanted to collect the economic rents on land, rather than collect taxes on wages, to fund the public need. The public rather than the owner of land would collect economic rent, taking the feudalism out of land ownership. There is a difference between law-made property and labor-made property, as there is a difference between unearned and earned wealth. Geolibertarians want to further distribute collected land rents, which is law-made wealth, directly to the people as a citizen dividend, respecting the citizens as equal and joint owners in common of the land, regardless of who holds law-made title for exclusive use of lands. The owner of land should pay rent to the citizens for claiming exclusive ownership of land.]]></description>
