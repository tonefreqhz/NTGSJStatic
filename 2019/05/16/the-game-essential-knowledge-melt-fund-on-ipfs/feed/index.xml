Hi Alison, sorry not to have replied sooner, I have been sending myself slowly barmy getting all the web 3 stuff I am doing working.
Board games are very popular here in Sweden, I used to enjoy Chess but dice and move games have not really ever interested me either.
The story of Monopoly is very interesting though.
&quot;Monopoly is derived from The Landlord&#039;s Game created by Lizzie Magie in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one where monopolists work under few constraints,[1] and to promote the economic theories of Henry George—in particular his ideas about taxation.[3] It was first published by Parker Brothers in 1935. The game is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity&quot;.from Wikipedia,

Heres to more folk opening their eyes.]]></description>
