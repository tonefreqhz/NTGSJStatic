What a wasted opportunity! I actually talked to Simon on the phone last Friday and told him to ask Carney about the 1914 Bradbury Pound and why Sovereign National Credit should be restored – that is the proven ability of HM Treasury to create, issue and control all the money needed for Britain’s sovereignty, prosperity and happiness. Called M0 at 100%, this is debt-free and interest-free money that is created by the government that is based on our nation’s wealth and labour potential…and it doesn’t lead to inflation. It was a retired Director of the Bank of England who tipped me off back in 2012 about this proven fiscal measure and that it would solve all of Britain’s economic woes. Positive Money knows all about this but has done absolutely nothing. And why does Positive Money never discuss the machinations of the secretive Bank for International Settlements which controls sixty of the world’s central banks including the Bank of England? Sorry, but this meeting was a completely wasted opportunity…especially as the hidden Deep State created the appalling science of Man-made Global Warming. I know this because Aurelio Peccei, the co-founder of the Club of Rome, told me personally back in 1982 that his organisation WAS CREATING A GLOBAL PROBLEM TO FRIGHTEN THE WORLD INTO ACCEPTING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE! And if you don’t believe me, ask Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers, a highly respected climatologist. Or Professor David Bellamy who told me bluntly, “it’s all bad science!”. Come on people, please wake up to the scam that the central banking system is and what the hidden and corporate Deep State is doing to all of us to take away our prosperity and ancient freedoms as they head us towards a debt-slavery Orwellian future.
