Roger Lewis Hi Mario, I agree with you Boris Johnson would not be someone I would ever wish for as a Freind or even acquaintance.
He does have qualities and political skills, not least his ability to put together effective teams. His appointment of Dominic Cummings is very astute, I rate cummings very highly he is the opposite of Boris Johnson

Mario Crisan Roger Lewis he definitely has his chance now to prove that but I’m not very hopeful. Iran and Brexit hard tasks and he’s a joker the only quality I’ve noticed so far.

Roger Lewis Hi Mario, I am sceptical as to the Priorities on his post-Brexit Agenda, I do though think he with Cummings will deliver Brexit, with or without a deal. I am Agnostic on Deal or no deal but do support Brexit. The reason I am not agnostic on Brexit as I once was is that the EU has deteriorated to over Authoritarian QUasi Stalinism. 
The Establishments Foreign Policy which Boris has headed as Foreign Secretary is not as advertised, this is true of All Foreign Policy in all States, Not least the USA where The Trump presidency will see another 4 years I am pretty sure. This is to the Advantage of those people that support a form of Small c conservative Internationalism and Genuine Free trade and Not Crony Financialised Capitalism. I suspect Boris is one of the Crony Squad, as is Trump I think, they are though preferable to the Stalinists of the EUssr and Obamas Muslim Brotherhood.
When you throw in the Zionist Lobby things get seriously complicated, especially if as I do you identify with the Israeli Left wing and oppose Netanyahu.]]></description>

To underestimate Boris is a Mistake for anyone. Time will tell how Britains Future pans out. Corbyn has made a mistake in embracing the so-called people&#039;s vote, in my own view. On CUrrent trajectory Boris will get Uk out of Europe and win the following Election, that will make the job of those of us who opposed Boris&#039;s policies on GM food and Fracking for instance much more difficult. I am of the Left but have always been a Libertarian Mario, sadly the Left these days is a sad parade of Middle-class Identitarian virtue signalling, Boris will eat those naive and hard of thinking Climate and SJW warriors for Breakfast. He also used the Climate Change buzz words, a real clue that he is an Authoritarian at Heart as a Libertarian that above anything causes me to oppose him, at this stage though he is doing a necessary Job, and it is being made easier by the Undermining of Cormyn by Watson, Benn, Cooper etc.]]></description>
