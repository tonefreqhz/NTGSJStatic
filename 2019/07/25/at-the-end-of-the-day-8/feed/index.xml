Mario Crisan Roger Lewis I don’t underestimate him, I simply think he’s an idiot who has the opposite values than I have, values given by parents and education.

Roger Lewis Hi Mario, I agree with you Boris Johnson would not be someone I would ever wish for as a Freind or even acquaintance.
He does have qualities and political skills, not least his ability to put together effective teams. His appointment of Dominic Cummings is very astute, I rate cummings very highly he is the opposite of Boris Johnson

Mario Crisan Roger Lewis he definitely has his chance now to prove that but I’m not very hopeful. Iran and Brexit hard tasks and he’s a joker the only quality I’ve noticed so far.

Roger Lewis Hi Mario, I am sceptical as to the Priorities on his post-Brexit Agenda, I do though think he with Cummings will deliver Brexit, with or without a deal. I am Agnostic on Deal or no deal but do support Brexit. The reason I am not agnostic on Brexit as I once was is that the EU has deteriorated to over Authoritarian QUasi Stalinism. 
The Establishments Foreign Policy which Boris has headed as Foreign Secretary is not as advertised, this is true of All Foreign Policy in all States, Not least the USA where The Trump presidency will see another 4 years I am pretty sure. This is to the Advantage of those people that support a form of Small c conservative Internationalism and Genuine Free trade and Not Crony Financialised Capitalism. I suspect Boris is one of the Crony Squad, as is Trump I think, they are though preferable to the Stalinists of the EUssr and Obamas Muslim Brotherhood.
When you throw in the Zionist Lobby things get seriously complicated, especially if as I do you identify with the Israeli Left wing and oppose Netanyahu.]]></description>
