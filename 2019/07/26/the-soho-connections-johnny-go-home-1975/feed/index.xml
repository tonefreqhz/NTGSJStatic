Superb incisive article Ranjan, an old school bait and switch by the Establishment and for the protection of the Establishment is indeed afoot.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus
c. 371 – c. 287 BC
XXVI. The Oligarch (xxix)
“The Oligarchical temper would seem to consist in a love of authority, covetous, not of gain, but of power.
The Oligarch is one who, when the people are deliberating whom they shall associate with the archon as joint directors of the procession, will come forward and express his opinion that these directors ought to have plenary powers; and, if others propose ten, he will say that ‘one is sufficient,’ but that ‘he must be a man.’. Of Homer’s poetry, he has mastered only this line, —
No good comes of a manifold rule; let the ruler be one:
of the rest, he is absolutely ignorant.”

Theophratus.

Paedophile dossier
In July 2014, it was revealed that the late Baroness Castle had compiled a paedophile dossier in the 1980s and had handed it to Don Hale, the editor of her local newspaper, the Bury Messenger. Lady Castle put together 30 pages of information about alleged attempts by the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) to infiltrate government while seeking funding and trying to persuade MPs to legalise sex with children. As well as key members of both the Commons and Lords, she found that about 30 prominent businessmen, public school teachers, scoutmasters and police officers had links to PIE. Mr Hale, 61, said:

“Barbara was horrified at the rapid extent of PIE’s involvement with key people and her file included details of about 16 household-name MPs.”
He said Lady Castle – who at the time was Euro MP Barbara Castle – passed him the dossier and asked if he would write a story based on it.

“I agreed to run something the following week but obviously had to contact certain MPs named – from the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties – and the Home Office for their responses. The next day, Cyril Smith came to my office. He must have heard about it, or been sent by, the former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. Cyril tried to persuade me that it was ‘all poppycock’. He said Barbara had her ‘knickers in a twist’ since leaving the House and had become bored with wine lakes and sugar mountains in Europe. He played down the whole episode and wanted an assurance that I wouldn’t run anything. I couldn’t give that and he went away very disappointed. The next day the heavy mob arrived. Two or three police in uniform and half a dozen in plain clothes. They came at 8am, before most people had arrived for work, and showed me warrant cards and a D-Notice and something signed by a Judge. They threatened me with five to ten years in prison and took away my notebooks and all the papers Barbara had given me. It was a threat to national security, and not in the public interest, they told me. If I had said no, I would have been arrested. I had to give them assurances I had given them everything. They told me not to tell anyone, and the whole thing was over within half an hour.”
Mr Hale went on to be a campaigning editor at the Matlock Mercury newspaper known for his investigation that led to the freeing of Stephen Downing, wrongly jailed for the “Bakewell Tart” murder. But he said it was the incident with the Lady Castle dossier that sparked his determination to expose cover-ups:

“Barbara had been a long-serving local MP and used to come and have a chat with me every couple of weeks. We had talked about a potential paedophile ring with MPs before, but she said no one would listen. She asked me if I would take a look and run a story from her point of view. She objected to any funding of this organisation PIE, and was very concerned about the speed of their infiltration and the number of prominent names who were allegedly supporting them. Barbara was horrified, too, at the prospect of Parliament approving legalised sex with children, often under the guise of educating them, and mentioned an influx of rent boys and unsavoury and unfortunate situations that had been covered up by the authorities.”
Mr Hale said she had not been surprised when he told her about the visit from Special Branch:

[R]
“She sort of expected it. This was a powerful organisation and she reluctantly admitted she was fighting a formidable foe. She apologised for the hassle it caused me. It was 30 years ago, so I can’t remember the names and full details, but I was sworn to secrecy by Special Branch at the risk of jail if I repeated any of the allegations.”[9]
