					<description><![CDATA[SOME BIG LIES OF SCIENCE
“THE MAJORITY OF POLITICIANS, ON THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO US, ARE INTERESTED NOT IN TRUTH BUT IN POWER AND IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT POWER. TO MAINTAIN THAT POWER IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT PEOPLE REMAIN IN IGNORANCE, THAT THEY LIVE IN IGNORANCE OF THE TRUTH, EVEN THE TRUTH OF THEIR OWN LIVES. WHAT SURROUNDS US THEREFORE IS A VAST TAPESTRY OF LIES, UPON WHICH WE FEED.” – HAROLD PINTER, NOBEL PRIZE LECTURE (LITERATURE), 2005
THE MAINTENANCE OF THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES THAT CONTROL OUR LIVES DEPENDS ON PINTER’S “VAST TAPESTRY OF LIES UPON WHICH WE FEED.” THEREFORE THE MAIN INSTITUTIONS THAT EMBED US INTO THE HIERARCHY, SUCH AS SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, AND MASS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATIONS, HAVE A PRIMARY FUNCTION TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN THIS TAPESTRY. THIS INCLUDES ESTABLISHMENT SCIENTISTS AND ALL SERVICE INTELLECTUALS IN CHARGE OF “INTERPRETING” REALITY.
IN FACT, THE SCIENTISTS AND “EXPERTS” DEFINE REALITY IN ORDER TO BRING IT INTO CONFORMATION WITH THE ALWAYS-ADAPTING DOMINANT MENTAL TAPESTRY OF THE MOMENT. THEY ALSO INVENT AND BUILD NEW BRANCHES OF THE TAPESTRY THAT SERVE SPECIFIC POWER GROUPS BY PROVIDING NEW AVENUES OF EXPLOITATION. THESE HIGH PRIESTS ARE REWARDED WITH HIGH CLASS STATUS.
CONCLUSION
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON. WHAT IS NOT A LIE?
LOOK AT THE RECENT H1N1 SCAM – ANOTHER TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE. IT’S FARCICAL HOW FAR THESE CIRCUSES GO: ANTISEPTIC GELS IN EVERY DOORWAY AT THE BLINK OF AN EYE; HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GETTING HIGH FROM DRINKING THE ALCOHOL IN THE GELS; OUT DATEDNESS OF THE VIRAL STRAIN BEFORE THE PRE-PAID VACCINE CAN BE MASS PRODUCED; UNPROVEN EFFECTIVENESS; NO REQUIREMENT TO PROVE EFFECTIVENESS; GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES TO CORPORATE MANUFACTURERS AGAINST CLIENT LAWSUITS; UNIVERSITY SAFETY OFFICERS TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO COUGH; ETC.
PURE MADNESS. HAS SOMETHING TRIGGERED OUR GENETICALLY INGRAINED FIRST WORLD STUPIDITY REFLEX? IS THIS PART OF OUR MARCH TOWARDS FASCISM [8]?
HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. EDUCATORS PROMOTE THE LIE THAT WE LEARN BECAUSE WE ARE TAUGHT. THIS LIE OF EDUCATION IS SQUARELY DENOUNCED BY RADICAL EDUCATORS [9][10].
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS DESIGN CURRICULA AS THOUGH THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY LEARN EVERY ELEMENT THAT IS DELIVERED WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT STUDENTS DON’T LEARN THE DELIVERED MATERIAL AND EVERYONE ONLY LEARNS WHAT THEY LEARN. ONE COULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE ORDER IN WHICH COURSES ARE DELIVERED AND IT WOULD MAKE NO MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE IN HOW MUCH STUDENTS LEARN. STUDENTS DELIVER NONSENSE AND PROFESSORS DON’T CARE. OBEDIENCE AND INDOCTRINATION ARE ALL THAT MATTER SO THE ONLY REQUIRED SKILL IS BLUFFING. STUDENTS KNOW THIS AND THOSE THAT DON’T DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW, DON’T KNOW THEMSELVES.
PICK ANY EXPERT OPINION OR DOMINANT PARADIGM: IT’S PART OF A RACKET.
WE CAN’T KNOW THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS BRUTAL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Human Psychology is the apparatus that processes Ego and our outward interactions with other people in accordance with what we think they are seeing and want to see. That Behaviour , the wish to please or be approved of, is where manipulation comes in, where consent is manufactured, if you will.
Theological arguments around the question of Free-will or Determination go back a long way as well but the Quarrel between St Augustine and Pelagius goes to this point and still remains a point of contention between different Faith Groupings.
My point is that those arguments are arguments about not Human Nature that which we are through Nature or because of God. No, they are to do with Behaviours which are manipulated through the Ego interaction between Our False centres. Our inner beings or true selves are where our deeper Human Nature resides and much of what our Ego or our Human Psychology determines that we should do conflicts with our Human nature, That we do bad things does not mean that our Natures are inherently sinful but only that we can be manipulated psychologically to do things against our Better natures.
I have written before about Foucault’s notion of the Episteme,
also about Timonism and Calvinism. I do not think I have mentioned before the Cenodoxus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenodoxus

					<description><![CDATA[David Greber described it as the Underside of the Western Tradition in a 2005 Article in the Commoner Periodical.
the underside of the Western tradition
“Western philosophy, after all, really begins with the quarrel between Heraclitus and Parmenides; a quarrel that Parmenides won. As a result, from almost the very start, the Western tradition marked itself by imagining objects that exist, as it were, outside
of time and transformation. So much so that the obvious reality of change has always been something of a problem.”
David Graeber. p.19.

					<description><![CDATA[“We must now take precautions to prevent you from being embarrassed by something in which the ignorant majority is at fault for lack of proper consideration, and so from supposing with them, that man has not been created truly good simply because he is able to do evil. … If you reconsider this matter carefully and force your mind to apply a more acute understanding to it, it will be revealed to you that man’s status is better and higher for the very reason for which it is thought to be inferior: it is on this choice between two ways, on this freedom to choose either alternative, that the glory of the rational mind is based, it is in this that the whole honor of our nature consists, it is from this that its dignity is derived.”
