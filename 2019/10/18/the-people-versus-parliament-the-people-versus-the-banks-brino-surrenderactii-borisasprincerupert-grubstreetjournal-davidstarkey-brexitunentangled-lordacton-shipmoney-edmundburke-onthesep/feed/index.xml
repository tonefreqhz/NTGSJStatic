“It will be a rigged second referendum. That Letwin amendment has been worked on for months. It is not a trvial delay”.

That is I think a good sighting shot, at this point, what we are more able to discern is that the EU’s modern version of the Maginot Line defense remains unchanged. The EU position is as ever if at first we don’t succeed make them vote again.

“Katy Balls of The Spectator spells out the strategy all along. Avoid blame. If that’s done it’s job done for Boris”.

The first comment I read says that the question on any second ref should not have Remain as an option. I have cut and pasted a comment from back in January I made on the Dr Tim Morgan seeds blog. the Anatole Kaletsky view is that of the EUssr commisars both in Brussels and their would-be Pashas in the UK. Kaletsky analyses the scenarios of the second referendum ballot question.

Regarding Brexit,
My own view is that The Establishment in Britain by the most part does not want Brexit to happen if one reads Project Syndicate and Anatoly

Reversing Brexit
Jul 27, 2016 ANATOLE KALETSKY
Instead of rushing Brexit, Europe’s leaders should be trying to avert it, by persuading British voters to change their minds. The aim should not be to negotiate the terms of departure, but to negotiate the terms on which most British voters would want to remain.

2. Bonus 1. English Assembly
3. Bonus.2 Save Union Scotland.
Bonus 3, Introduce PR = permanent hung Parly. I.e needn’t worry about Jeremy Corbyn Govt @jeremycorbyn

When I was proposing the Grand cross-party Idea after the 2017 GE this was my prediction of how this would all get resolved, I still think it will play out this way. I am still agnostic on in or out as it makes no difference as long as the Neo-Cons have Trump by the short and curlies, which they seem to have.

To wit, I must say I agree with

“IMV Brexit is a sideshow. In the long run I think a no deal exit would make very little difference economically and it’s the long run that matters.

What does matter are the trends that Tim writes about which will continue to undermine economies of whatever stripe, including of course those of the EU itself and not just the UK.

There are growing signs of substantial change in the EU and I think this will gather momentum over the next few years and the supranational, neoliberal model will come under increasing question.”

Last word to ANATOLE KALETSKY Is Canceling Brexit Now Inevitable?

As matters stand today, a new British referendum on leaving the European Union would produce a clear majority for remaining a member, regardless of how the votes were counted or the questions were asked. And with the only two Brexit options set to be rejected next month, the questions are increasingly likely to be asked.

VII. — FEDERATION
THE NEW WORLD ORDER
BY
H.G. WELLS
There is one direction in which Mr Streit’s proposals are open to improvement. Let us turn to another in which he does not seem to have realised all the implications of his proposal. This great Union is to have a union money and a union customs-free economy. What follows upon that? More I think than he realises.
There is one aspect of money to which the majority of those that discuss it seem to be incurably blind. You cannot have a theory of money or any plan about money by itself in the air. Money is not a thing in itself; it is a working part of an economic system. Money varies in its nature with the laws and ideas of property in a community. As a community moves towards collectivism and communism, for example, money simplifies out. Money is a necessary in a communism as it is in any other system, but its function therein is at its simplest. Payment in kind to the worker gives him no freedom of choice among the goods the community produces. Money does. Money becomes the incentive that “works the worker” and nothing more. Ed. NB

The New World Order is a book written by H. G. Wells, originally published in January 1940. Wells
And If I may a stanza from my poem,
GLOBALISATION UN-ENTANGLED. (A FOUND POEM, CIPHER OF GLOBALISM )
Eliza with Rogerian inscrutability
hears the confession of the mal-contents
A mirror held up before cosmetic application
Globalisation and Internationalism confused
despotism´s nature is to abhor any say
save that of its own momentary pleasure;
it annihilates all intermediate situations
between boundless strength on its own part,
and total debility on the part of the people.
Our education can be Our? our, government.
Our reason can be our Judge, of the rivals;
Globalism, Authority, coercion and competition.
or Nationalism, Internationalism, Cooperation.
Are we to have free will and democracy
Will we have determined authority
A struggle of ideals an ancient quarrel
Parmenides or Heraclitus navigators both

cut and paste ends.

What we see in action is the self-styled “Elites” ( one man’s gent is anothers’ chinless wonder) are clinging to an outmoded view of the Competing elites model of democracy.

One can think in terms of democracy among the International Elite based upon National Franchises. Schumpeter’s competing elites model of democracy serves double duty in demonstrating both the Political Theater of FAUX electoral political democracy and also in the behind closed doors machinations of the powerful list found in magazines like Forbes. ´´( quotes from Roy Madron​, Super Competent Democracies).

‘Democracy is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political
decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a
competitive struggle for the people’s vote’.” Joseph Schumpeter, Quoted
from Roy Madron, Super Competent Democracies who in turn Cites.
“Participation, and Democratic Theory” by Carole Pateman. Dr Pateman
says that, Schumpeter and his followers: … set the current
Anglo-American political system as our democratic ideal (with) a
‘democratic theory’ that in many respects bears a strange resemblance to
the anti-democratic arguments of the last (i.e. 19th) century. No
longer is democratic theory centered on the participation of ‘the
people’; in the contemporary theory of democracy it is the participation
of the minority elite that is crucial and the non-participation of
the apathetic, ordinary man lacking in the feelings of political efficacy,
that is regarded as the main bulwark against
instability.

I spent a few hours yesterday reading Our gracious hosts earlier work on the way back machine. John has covered the machinations of “Brightest and the best” extensively and Brexit should be viewed as a passage through a larger landscape of all the dominant themes driven by two things. American Exceptionalism and Dollar hegemony and its relationship to the petrodollar. ( PEANAC) and the Limits of Growth Club of Rome agendas expressed through Agendas 2021 and 2030 of the UN. For the UK the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal still drives a huge agenda in Yemen and other places.

At the very bottom of it all, I think we are moving to Lord Acton’s dictum of.

” The issue which has swept down through the centuries and must be fought sooner or later is the people versus the banks.”
Lord Acton

The Remembrancer is one of the City of London Corporation’s Chief Officers; the role dates back to 1571. His traditional role is as the channel of communications between the Lord Mayor and the City of London on the one hand and the Sovereign, Royal Household and Parliament on the other. The Remembrancer is also the City’s Ceremonial Officer and Chief of Protocol.

Since 2003, the Remembrancer has been Paul Double.[1] He joined the City of London from the Bar and earlier government service. His work in Parliament has centered on the legislation to implement the changes to the City’s electoral system]]></description>

or Nationalism, Internationalism, Cooperation.<br />
Are we to have free will and democracy<br />
Will we have determined authority<br />
A struggle of ideals an ancient quarrel<br />
Parmenides or Heraclitus navigators both</p>
<p>cut and paste ends.</p>
<p>What we see in action is the self-styled “Elites” ( one man’s gent is anothers’ chinless wonder) are clinging to an outmoded view of the Competing elites model of democracy.</p>
<p>One can think in terms of democracy among the International Elite based upon National Franchises. Schumpeter’s competing elites model of democracy serves double duty in demonstrating both the Political Theater of FAUX electoral political democracy and also in the behind closed doors machinations of the powerful list found in magazines like Forbes. ´´( quotes from Roy Madron​, Super Competent Democracies).</p>
<p>‘Democracy is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political<br />
decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a<br />
competitive struggle for the people’s vote’.” Joseph Schumpeter, Quoted<br />
from Roy Madron, Super Competent Democracies who in turn Cites.<br />
“Participation, and Democratic Theory” by Carole Pateman. Dr Pateman<br />
says that, Schumpeter and his followers: … set the current<br />
Anglo-American political system as our democratic ideal (with) a<br />
‘democratic theory’ that in many respects bears a strange resemblance to<br />
the anti-democratic arguments of the last (i.e. 19th) century. No<br />
longer is democratic theory centered on the participation of ‘the<br />
people’; in the contemporary theory of democracy it is the participation<br />
of the minority elite that is crucial and the non-participation of<br />
the apathetic, ordinary man lacking in the feelings of political efficacy,<br />
that is regarded as the main bulwark against<br />
instability.<br />

<p>I spent a few hours yesterday reading Our gracious hosts earlier work on the way back machine. John has covered the machinations of “Brightest and the best” extensively and Brexit should be viewed as a passage through a larger landscape of all the dominant themes driven by two things. American Exceptionalism and Dollar hegemony and its relationship to the petrodollar. ( PEANAC) and the Limits of Growth Club of Rome agendas expressed through Agendas 2021 and 2030 of the UN. For the UK the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal</a> still drives a huge agenda in Yemen and other places.</p>
<p>At the very bottom of it all, I think we are moving to Lord Acton’s dictum of.</p>
<p>” The issue which has swept down through the centuries and must be fought sooner or later is the people versus the banks.”<br />
Lord Acton</p>

<p>The Remembrancer is one of the City of London Corporation’s Chief Officers; the role dates back to 1571.
