Your comment is awaiting moderation.
It is not my elucidation it is Chris Hedges. I have actually made my own disagreements with a few particularly the Climate narrative aspects of the Hedges article. I have not linked to it here ( my blog that is) Frankly STeven I am rather fed up with your straw-manning me. I am still waiting for the paper you say you published in 2000. The debate here is limited by people such as yourself behaving in all the ways you accuse others of, Our exchanges have been less than illuminating for me , that the feeling is mutual I do not doubt, but do stop the pathetic straw-manning it is rather tedious.]]></description>

“Money”, by Philip Larkin
Quarterly, is it, money reproaches me:
‘Why do you let me lie here wastefully?
I am all you never had of goods and sex.
You could get them still by writing a few cheques.’
So I look at others, what they do with theirs:
They certainly don’t keep it upstairs.
By now they’ve a second house and car and wife:
Clearly money has something to do with life
—In fact, they’ve a lot in common, if you enquire:
You can’t put off being young until you retire,
And however you bank your screw, the money you save
Won’t in the end buy you more than a shave.
I listen to money singing. It’s like looking down
From long french windows at a provincial town,
The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad
In the evening sun. It is intensely sad.

a very good Chris Hedges piece on Truthdig,
The Age of Radical Evil.
https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-age-of-radical-evil/

“These architects of radical evil extract the coal, oil and gas, poisoning our air, soil and water, while demanding huge taxpayer subsidies and blocking the urgent transition to renewable energy. ”

“Corporate culture serves a faceless system. It is, as Hannah Arendt wrote, “the rule of nobody and for this very reason perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.” It will stop at nothing. Anyone or any movement that attempts to impede their profits will be targeted for obliteration. ”

But who are those who resist? Where do they come from? What historical, social and cultural forces created them?

They too are familiar. They are Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, John Brown, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. They are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. They are Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Emma Goldman. They are “Big Bill” Haywood, Joe Hill and Eugene V. Debs. They are Woody Guthrie, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They are Andrea Dworkin and Caesar Chavez. They are those who from the beginning fought back, often to be defeated by this radical evil but knowing they were called to defy it, even at the cost of their own reputations, financial security, social standing and sometimes their lives.

While many may agree with your declaration and elucidation of evil, those are normative evaluations. The Bell Curve has a greed/power tail as well as a voluntary simplicity one. The drivers are biological. Societal feedback can work to manage the situation, and it is easier in groups of a few hundred including kids and the elderly than in those of tens of thousands and larger. Group responsibility is operative in social mammals. Feedback and knowledge is diluted by scale.]]></description>
