“Roger, you have posted numerous comments linking to the same site, presumably your own. If you’ll refrain from doing that for a period, that would be helpful.”

Hi Tim, I have also been studying the monetary system and particularly Energy Economics for quite a long time, Soddy’s Work and also the Work of Technocracy back in the 1930’s was alive to the point. As such when I link to my own Blog it is to the full extent of the references I have made to those questions.

The Internet is about Links, Hyper text Transfer Protocol .(HTTP) and ( “URL’s )(Uniform Resource Locator’s) is a way of addressing Meta data and searching for needles in haystacks and for attribution.
I also make video and link to those, Search engine optimisation is very much driven by link backs and cross-references and my linking as well as providing source material is designed to bring traffic back to this Blog.

Strawmanning of argumentation is a ubiquitous feature of the internet as is forum sliding and de-platforming both subtle covert and overt. All these things are relevant to Media outlets that challenge established Narratives.
Mark Carney’s recent sermons on Net Zero Carbon and punishment for those who refuse to buy into the narrative and the ( Carbon Credits) and Yannis Varafoukis’s recent Project Syndicate Article on The IBS adopting Libra the CryptoCurrency are all relevant to both the core subject of this Blog but also the context of the political economy and geopolitical context.

My own blog is linked to my WordPress avatar and it is one which I do link to often but on subjects in which I claim, considerable expertise but not a monopoly.

While many may agree with your declaration and elucidation of evil, those are normative evaluations. The Bell Curve has a greed/power tail as well as a voluntary simplicity one. The drivers are biological. Societal feedback can work to manage the situation, and it is easier in groups of a few hundred including kids and the elderly than in those of tens of thousands and larger. Group responsibility is operative in social mammals. Feedback and knowledge is diluted by scale.

Guidelines for commenting

We’ve had some healthy discussion here about what is and what isn’t acceptable comment. Obviously, we want the maximum of discussion here. But we don’t want the experience of the many undermined by a minority.

So – and this itself, of course, is up for discussion – I’m trialling an approach which I call ‘two gates, a filter and a request’.

The two gates to be navigated are:

– Relevance to energy, economics and finance

– Reasonable brevity

The filter is courtesy and respect for others’ points of view. The slogan for this, borrowed from sport, is “play the ball, not the man”.

So it’s fine to say to someone that “your argument is idiotic”

But it’s not fine to say “you are an idiot”.

Finally, the request is that you don’t post a disproportionately large number of comments, insert too many links, or include too many ‘additions’ (such as video clips).

The response to comments breaching these guidelines is review. This isn’t the same as a ban or block. Instead, anyone whose comment breaches these guidelines will have his or her future comments moderated – but any comments which don’t breach these guidelines will still be approved in moderation.

Hello Tim,
All of my posts have been moderated here for a long time when Links are included I know it is possible on WordPress to hold in moderation any posts with links or with N no of links according to the Blogger’s own preference.
If I post both briefly and on point, my posts are still moderated, I do not like it but I value the discourse here more than my dislike of the treatment afforded vis moderation. Your house your rules afterall “An English Mans Blog is his castle”,
Or are you like me a Welshman?

As I often Re-Blog your posts and where I find that I wish to take issue or expand on limitations I consider in their reference points I have taken to simply expanding a dialogue in the comments or at the bottom of my own re-blogged post.

“”So it’s fine to say to someone that “your argument is idiotic”

But it’s not fine to say “you are an idiot”.

Really? this is stretching it IMO, my last Comment complaining of regular straw-manning is still in moderation, it is not discourteous but makes a valid point.

Best wishes
Roger]]></description>

Clearly money has something to do with life<br />
—In fact, they’ve a lot in common, if you enquire:<br />
You can’t put off being young until you retire,<br />
And however you bank your screw, the money you save<br />
Won’t in the end buy you more than a shave.<br />
I listen to money singing. It’s like looking down<br />
From long french windows at a provincial town,<br />
The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad<br />
In the evening sun. It is intensely sad.</p>
<p>a very good Chris Hedges piece on Truthdig,<br />
The Age of Radical Evil.<br />
<a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-age-of-radical-evil/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-age-of-radical-evil/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;These architects of radical evil extract the coal, oil and gas, poisoning our air, soil and water, while demanding huge taxpayer subsidies and blocking the urgent transition to renewable energy. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporate culture serves a faceless system. It is, as Hannah Arendt wrote, “the rule of nobody and for this very reason perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.” It will stop at nothing. Anyone or any movement that attempts to impede their profits will be targeted for obliteration. &#8221;</p>
<p>But who are those who resist? Where do they come from? What historical, social and cultural forces created them?</p>
<p>They too are familiar. They are Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, John Brown, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. They are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. They are Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Emma Goldman. They are “Big Bill” Haywood, Joe Hill and Eugene V. Debs. They are Woody Guthrie, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They are Andrea Dworkin and Caesar Chavez. They are those who from the beginning fought back, often to be defeated by this radical evil but knowing they were called to defy it, even at the cost of their own reputations, financial security, social standing and sometimes their lives.</p>

I think David Malone has used the Term in several of his Blogs on Greece, In fact I seem to recall seeing your own comments there too and at Off Guardian.

Now the claimed Systems thinkers amongst us will be familiar with the concept of Wicked Problems and Convergent and divergent problems.

The Scientific method is great for Convergent Soluble sort and not so good for the Divergent Wicked Sort.

Can I ask, politely, why you post so many links here? Speaking personally, I don’t have the time to follow them up, though of course others may. I’m pretty busy and have to plan prettycarefully.

Current seeds numbers should tell us enough about where we are heading.
We have numbers and we have words. Mixing up those doesn’t add anything to the conclusion.
Its like putting a ‘price’ on gold. In my opinion, dear doc, you can skip efforts putting numbers on words and let the blog figure it out.

The analysis regarding EROEI and its effect on prosperity potential is one thing, Continuing Economic models are failing for other reasons in addition to available cheaply priced Energy. ( Crony Capitalism is the buzz term I believe)
Placing all of ones’ analytical ammo into the seeds weapon would be a strategic mistake.
Another mistake is accepting the starting assumptions and definitions moulded in the Growth Paradigm and applying them to a post-growth paradigm.
Finally, Seeds is not looking at the embodied energy question which gets very interesting when one considers re-cycling and circular economy, this question gets into use models over ownership models, this speaks to efficiency of energy use and not to some ideological measure of fairness or equality, or indeed some subjective voodoo related to the time value of money.
