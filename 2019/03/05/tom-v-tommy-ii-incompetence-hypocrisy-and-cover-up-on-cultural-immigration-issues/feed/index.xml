Tommy is a zionist shill…

Zionism and an interest in the Jewish people in Israel who do not support Netanyahu Zionism are two very different things. It strikes me that Tommy may be less well informed on ZIonism than he is on Islam I doubt somehow that he has read much Sufi philosophy or indeed Maimonides.

Always in divide and rule strategies of the Oligarchy, a fostering of my enemies enemy is my friend thinking is adopted and encouraged.

“The Vision of Christ that thou dost see
Is my Visions Greatest Enemy
Thine has a great hook nose like thine
Mine has a snub nose like to mine5Thine is the Friend of All Mankind
Mine speaks in parables to the Blind
Thine loves the same world that mine hates
Thy Heaven doors are my Hell Gates
Socrates taught what Melitus10Loathd as a Nations bitterest Curse
And Caiphas was in his own Mind
A benefactor of Mankind
Both read the Bible day &#038; night
But thou readst black where I read white”

This article makes the assumption that there is only one zionism.
It would be a mistake to assume there is only one Jew and to be anti-Jew because of the actions of one person.
It is also possible that deciding to be anti-zionist because you find Netanyahu-zionism appalling is a similar mistake.
How did Netanyahu-zionism – an extreme form of zionism – get to define zionism?
I personally reject Netanyahu-zioinism because in my view it cannot lead to a solution to existing problems in the middle east. It can only make those problems worse and worse.
That does not mean I reject zionism – the zionism of the early years of the state as practised by the few Israelis I knew. My understanding of their vision and their life seemed to me something that could have led to a stable future.
That was pre-wall, pre-extreme settlement policy days.
I am not convinced that Netanyahu-zionism was an inevitable outcome of those days. I could be wrong. I am not sure how anyone could prove that Netanyahu-zionism is the only possible zionism. I certainly don’t understand why so many people act as if Netanyahu-zionism is the only possible zionism.

Hi Kevin, in the comments the whole polarity and polarisation alienation of the debate plays out . Over and over the same taunts are rehearsed.

Jay, I do not know how much you know about Politics in Israel, and how deeply you have read into the Geo Politics surrounding Zionism in the late 19th Century and going back further into Jewish History and indeed Feudalism. Its a big ask to expect everyone to accord to your own take on things and to assume they operate in accordance to your own assemblage of information and understanding.

Enchiridion 42: How logic proves no fucks should ever be given towards other’s thoughts or actions towards you
Man this really hit hard for me and drilled it in. On one hand, it is easy to say “Stop worrying about what is out of your control.” But this passage hit the nail on the head for me and explained it in a way that metabolizes it for my subconscious.

“42. When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to him.” ”
