https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2f8nYMCO2I This 1990 Video of Mrs Thatcher reporting to the House on the European Council meeting at Rome held on 27/28 October. Marks I think the Watershed for where The Neo Liberal EU kicked in. That Mrs Thatcher is the Poster Girl of Neo Liberalism along with President Reagan is somewhat paradoxical but it stems back to Factions in the Oligarchy. Industrial Capitalism and Finance Capitalism are really not batting on the same side a point pointed out By Carol Quigley in Tragedy and Hope but also by Marx in Kapital.
“Talk about cen­tral­i­sa­tion! The credit sys­tem, which has its focus in the so-called national banks and the big money-lenders and usurers sur­round­ing them, con­sti­tutes enor­mous cen­tral­i­sa­tion, and gives this class of par­a­sites the fab­u­lous power, not only to peri­od­i­cally despoil indus­trial cap­i­tal­ists, but also to inter­fere in actual pro­duc­tion in a most dan­ger­ous man­ner— and this gang knows noth­ing about pro­duc­tion and has noth­ing to do with it.” –

Tony Benn and Dr David Owen both make very interesting points in questions to Mrs Thatcher, it is also interesting to read the body Language of Ken Clarke and John Major through the Debate, Neil Kinnock is also providing much material for the Spitting Image crew.]]></description>
