					<description><![CDATA[https://twitter.com/AnnPettifor/status/1085306017997570050  Anne Pettifor clarified a Tweet I saw last night which turns out to be a QUote from Stephen Kinnock, that is a good clue to what the Blairites are up too. Kinnock like his Father and so forth is up to his Ears in the EU trough of course.

Factions and there are many. but broadly there are 4.

1. Norway +++ ( arguably not as bad as Checquers .)

2. Cananda +++ which is really TTIP by the back door and still neo liberal.

3. Mays deal Chequers with a beard? ( it did get 196 votes)

4. Leave under WTO rules

5. Cancel Brexit altogether ( The Peoples Vote lot )


1. Is the EU unreformable?
2. Military Unification?
3. WIll Trump win in 2020, and How strong are his Neo Con credentials, there may be moves to oust Bolton apparently, let&#039;s not hold our breath.
4. Bank of England . Carney wants Brexit cancelled really  I think, Lord King supports Brexit and WTO, that is where the real decision gets made I think. Along with Military Industrial Complex factions on the Nato versus EU military Unification question and finally the Obama Moslem Brotherhood faction on MENA policy versus the Neo Con, Al Queda, Daesh, Whitehelmuts faction.]]></description>
