					<description><![CDATA[Transcript A. Neil gauntlet to Boris Johnson

so here we go one to be done Boris
55:07
Johnson the prime minister
55:09
we have been asking him for weeks now to
55:11
give us a date of time a venue as of now
55:15
none has been forthcoming no broadcaster
55:18
can compel a politician to be
55:19
interviewed but leaders interviews have
55:21
been a key part of the BBC&#039;s primetime
55:24
election coverage for decades we do them
55:26
on your behalf to scrutinize and hold
55:29
to account those who would govern us
55:31
that is democracy
55:33
we always proceeded in good faith that
55:35
the leaders would participate in every
55:38
election they have all of them it is not
55:42
too late we have an interview prepared
55:45
oven ready as mr. Johnson Likes to say
on the
55:48
theme running through our questions is
55:49
trust and Why so many times in his
55:52
career in politics and journalism
55:54
critics and sometimes even those close
55:56
to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy
55:59
it is of course relevant to what he is
56:02
promising as all now 
How can he be trusted
56:05
1.
to deliver 50,000 more nurses and almost
56:08
20,000 in his numbers are already
56:10
working for the NHS 

2.
he promises 40 new
56:14
hospitals it only six are scheduled to
56:16
be built by 2025 can he be believed when
56:20
he claims another 34 will be built in
56:22
the five years after
56:27
3.
can you be trusted to fund the NHS
56:29
properly when he uses the cash figure of
56:32
an extra thirty four billion pounds
56:34
after inflation the additional money
56:36
promised a month to 20 billion 
4.

He claims 
56:40
that the NHS will not be on the table in
56:42
any trade talks with America but then he
56:44
vowed to the DUP his unionist allies in
56:47
Northern Ireland that there would never
56:49
be a border down the Irish Sea
56:51
that is as important to the DUP as the
56:54
NHS is to the rest of us 
it is about his
56:57
brexit deal which seemed to break

5. 
 now he
57:00
tells us he&#039;s always been an opponent of
57:02
austerity we would ask him for evidence
57:05
of that we would want to know why an
57:07
opponent of austerity would make so much
57:10
of it into their future spending plans
57:12

6.
we would ask why as with the proposed
57:15
increase in police numbers so many of
57:17
his promises only take us back to the
57:19
future back to where we were before
57:22
austerity began

7.
 Social Care is an issue
57:25
of growing concern in the steps of
57:27
Downing Street in July he said he&#039;d
57:28
prepared a plan for Social Care we&#039;d
57:32
asked him why that plan is not in the manifesto?

8.
questions of
57:36
trust questions we&#039;d like to put to mr.
57:39
Johnson so you can hear his replies but
57:43
we can&#039;t because he won&#039;t sit down with
57:45
us there is no law no Supreme Court
57:47
ruling that can force mr. Johnson to
57:49
participate in bbc leaders interview
57:52
the prime minister of our nation will at
57:55
times have to stand up to president
57:58
Trump  and Putin  and President Z of China
58:01
so we&#039;re surely not expecting too much
58:04
and that he spent half an hour standing up to
58:07
me]]></description>
