					<description><![CDATA[https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/latest-poll-grimsby-general-election-3564637

I would not hang my hat on the Economist Grimsby Poll 

Survation interviewed 401 people aged over 18 in the town by telephone between November 14 and November 15. It coincided with Brexit party leader Nigel Farage visiting Grimsby to launch

The Local MP has actually voted honourably.


Ms Onn backed Remain in the EU referendum but she was one of the 19 Labour rebels to defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal at its second reading in the House of Commons late last month, saying she had a duty to respect the wishes of voters in Grimsby.

She has spoken out against a second referendum in the past and has advocated a Labour-type Brexit in which there would be some form of customs union with the EU and close alignment with the single market.

https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/great-grimsby-2019-general-election-3504657

Given the Brino is not Brexit and will increasingly be exposed for the fraud that it is. And also as since the economist Poll Nigel Farage performed his Vault face I strongly suspect that This one will be closer than predicted.

There seems to be a lot of clutching at straws. 

On Polling generally heres Boris Quoting Lyntton Crosby,

The Quals always lead the Quants Mate.

on that point, Jeremy Corbyn&#039;s personality and fitfulness scores have improved in the purdah period as has been shown in a number of polls, of course, his numbers are still poor even after improvement, Boris does not fair a great deal better although he is much more effective than May. One suspects there are many more Banana Skins liable to find their way into Boris&#039;s Path, with Corbyn, it&#039;s much the same recycle and I must say rather hackneyed stuff. Corbyn has Scrubbed up rather better than Boris ever will, a Veteran pointing out Dandruff on Bojos Collar today and his untucked in shirts etc, the wreath placed upside down on the cenotaph etc.. Bojo is accident prone and when the Labour Surrogates go to work a lot of his skeletons will be in social media, 


Lord Ashcroft is more sceptical with his Focus Group in Scotland.

I think about 3 days out we will have a better sense of the likely result, it will go down to the wire and The Tories are not as far ahead as they expected hence the Cummings Bat-Signal. I think Labour has a disciplined and structured approach to rolling out issues and still have EU Military unification up their sleeves, Farage was threatening to play that card which does blow Brino out of the water. A final push on Brino is not Brexit is a card I think Labour will play, its as obvious a card to play as the WASPI one was.]]></description>
