					<description><![CDATA[War on “conspiracy theories” goes ballistic! Gordon Duff shows his guns on False Flag Weekly News
By Kevin Barrett - February 3, 201963828
By Kevin Barrett, Veterans Today Editor

Our top FFWN story this week was the war on “conspiracy theories.” (Read my new Unz Review article “Why the War on Conspiracy Theories Is Bad Public Policy.”)

When my email from Comcast finally connected, I got a huge slew of 300 messages that I had deleted last summer. When I would try to log in, it would sit there and nothing would work. One possible qualifier: I was down on the Gulf Coast, going through a U-verse server, which is not my normal one. So I’m not sure if its a DoS or a comcast/ATT glitch…”]]></description>

Lo and behold, a great threat looms over the Middle East. There is nothing worse for the US and its select allies, Britain, France, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Germany than peace breaking out. Yet exactly that, the “threat of peace” is taken as far more devastating than terrorism.

America’s biggest enemy in the Middle East today isn’t ISIS, for those who pay attention, more effort has been made by the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and to be honest about it, a host of other nations as well, to save ISIS and al Qaeda from the “axis of evil” than any military effort since Vietnam.]]></description>
