The Idea is to provide the Materials and resources digitally and the location in Open Source web 3 space to build a Launchpad for local subsidiary canton (PDC) democracy cells and construct the necessary Democraticrocketss from components again supplied with a recipe book for local vernacular campaigning to tailor Ground games to particular ground game conditions. The challenge is as the previous paragraphs show to provide the Kit for PDC canto democracy with human readable and understandable instructions.
