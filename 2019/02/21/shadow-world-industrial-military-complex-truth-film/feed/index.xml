After they&#039;ve used the economic depression to achieve even greater &quot;political integration&quot; then it&#039;ll only be a matter of time before they unveil plans for an EU military. Perhaps the establishment of Britain thinks we are better off with NATO for the time being but sooner or late the EU will be pushing for a unified military and no doubt using the tried and tested existential threats of global terrorism to achieve this. I can almost hear the EU bureaucrats saying &quot;global terrorism is something we must unite together to fight therefore the EU military is essential if we to protect the free democratic countries of Europe&quot;. These people think Orwell&#039;s 1984 is an instruction manual.
