00:07
welcome to windows on the world extra or
00:10
show an infiltration and the paid agents
00:12
who discredit and attack researchers in
00:14
alternative media seem to have had some
00:16
effect the YouTube video of it attracted
00:19
some interesting and predictable
00:20
comments there has also been a further
00:22
attack on myself on the tpv forum this
00:25
is very timely as the documents have
00:27
been released on how government is
00:29
paying people to attack anyone not
00:31
spouting state propaganda as we also
00:33
revealed the fake stories are being
00:36
peddled to discredit and entrap
00:38
researchers and groups who are capable
00:40
of real investigative journalism I&#039;m
00:42
with David Shayler ex mi5 officer and
00:45
whistleblower to discuss this and what
00:47
we can do about it and it&#039;s a training
00:49
guide for GCHQ and NSA ages on
00:52
infiltrating and disrupting alternative
00:55
media online the four days are deny
00:57
disrupt degrade and deceive this is
01:01
known as online covert action something
01:04
appeared on the TPP forum a few days ago
01:08
and we were already attacked by these
01:10
people and it&#039;s very it&#039;s a very
01:12
interesting as an example of exactly
01:14
what they&#039;re talking about in the
01:15
document these people don&#039;t seem to have
01:17
an imagination they just seem to work to
01:19
a rule book so another way most of it is
01:21
reversal isn&#039;t it yeah well the fact you
01:24
say they work to a rule book is that&#039;s
01:25
how the opposition work they they almost
01:27
literally have a handbook about how they
01:29
deal with each aspect of protest or
01:31
rebellion or whatever else and and they
01:33
don&#039;t like departing from the rules
01:35
because they work in a very hierarchical
01:37
construction if you lower down the
01:38
structure you depart from the rules
01:39
you&#039;re gonna get in trouble with the
01:41
people higher up even if what you do
01:42
works you know so they are following the
01:44
rulebook and the rulebook says yes as
01:46
you say the four DS and those you know
01:48
say this is what it&#039;s all about you know
01:50
Chapman pinch wrote a book about
01:52
intelligence services called their trade
01:54
is treachery and this is what this is
01:56
what the intelligence says about their
01:57
not about protecting you because the
01:59
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have
02:01
put as it far greater risk that for our
02:03
lives at far greater risk of attack from
02:05
extremists but what they have been doing
02:07
all that time is trying to put out
02:09
misinformation about things like 9/11
02:11
for example so before we talk about this
02:12
case I will say that one of the person
02:14
who was in
02:15
all over this faction we know about was
02:17
also involved in removing me from 9/11
02:20
when we were having enormous success in
02:22
up until early 2007 in many case they&#039;ve
02:25
work on people&#039;s small-mindedness rather
02:27
than people actually being prey to the
02:28
operation themselves being partied about
02:30
yes absolutely correct so yes so people
02:32
coming to me attacking me shouting at me
02:34
screaming at me including I say this
02:36
person of the 9/11 truth movement now
02:38
that point the 9/11 truth movement split
02:41
and after that it fell apart it never
02:44
had the same profile because that point
02:45
we were getting on things like the
02:46
Jeremy Vine Show Sky News and the Steven
02:50
Walsh show these are one things with
02:51
millions of viewers basically so that
02:53
was all cut out and I even told these
02:55
people what was going on and they still
02:57
did it so let&#039;s be clear about this a
02:59
lot of this misinformation relies upon
03:02
what I call the Munchkin mentality those
03:04
twenty to forty percent out of people
03:05
out there who act like the herd can&#039;t
03:07
think for themselves and I&#039;ve seen those
03:09
people in their eyes go it&#039;s frightening
03:10
because you they lose the connection
03:12
with their soul basically and that one
03:14
thing explains how we have communist
03:17
Russia Nazi Germany every atrocity in
03:19
the world is carried out by groups
03:21
who&#039;ve lost their connection to their
03:23
conscience so yeah so that&#039;s what
03:25
they&#039;re using and they do have that
03:26
intrinsic understanding of human
03:28
psychology because these people who
03:30
belong to a group can&#039;t think for
03:31
themselves they will also blacken your
03:33
character by association and that&#039;s what
03:36
they&#039;re trying to do here with this
03:36
they&#039;re trying to accuse us with being
03:38
racists well it&#039;s yeah how did you say
03:40
about I totally utterly repudiate that I
03:43
have never ever been a racist and people
03:45
will know that by standing up for the
03:47
truth about 9/11 and 7/7 we are pointing
03:50
out the racism of the other side the
03:52
racism of government that blames Muslims
03:54
for the attack on 77 without any sort of
03:56
proper formal inquiry basic they played
03:58
the race card about two years ago and a
03:59
lot of people jumped to my defense which
04:01
was nice but really this stuff shouldn&#039;t
04:03
have got this far the point is that the
04:06
we&#039;ve got very lazy people out there and
04:08
people who are working for the
04:09
government get paid a lot of money to
04:11
discredit people like me all is I&#039;m
04:13
doing is presenting the show where I&#039;m
04:15
trying to help people from getting
04:16
houses taken off them stuff like that
04:18
now what&#039;s very insidious about this is
04:20
the fact that they&#039;ve kept on going on
04:23
me and people around me now I don&#039;t
04:26
consider myself to be a threat to the
04:28
Nationals
04:28
these people in my opinion our total
04:31
traitors to this country everything that
04:33
Britain is about no absolutely but the
04:35
problem is is they use a very perverse
04:37
definition of national security there&#039;s
04:39
insecurity in the sense of the
04:40
collateral for a loan so they&#039;re talking
04:42
about the financing of the country now
04:44
you know I be virtually anything we do
04:45
because it exposes this is therefore it
04:48
not in the interests of national
04:49
security in that sense however if we
04:52
were to talk about the broader interests
04:53
of the nation of course this works in
04:55
the interest of the nation it&#039;s not in
04:56
the interests of any country to live
04:58
under a regime that puts out propaganda
05:00
and lies it&#039;s not on the interests of
05:02
any country for a government to go
05:04
around oppressing the rights not just of
05:06
its own people obviously people are free
05:07
across the world where we&#039;ve invaded
05:09
countries so we are standing up for the
05:11
what&#039;s called a common good under the
05:13
under the common law and that&#039;s a phrase
05:15
that can&#039;t be perverted national
05:16
interest national security have
05:17
different meanings in Babylon that we
05:19
stand up for the common good essentially
05:21
and I think it&#039;s enormously suspicious
05:23
this is happening now Marc because as
05:24
you know people&#039;s voices starting to
05:26
take off your show starting to take off
05:28
I&#039;m returning to having more of a public
05:30
profile so this is an attempt to try and
05:32
cut us off at the past and stop that
05:34
happening basically now obviously we
05:36
rely upon the good sense of people out
05:38
there of course the 20 or 40 percent or
05:40
munchkins will believe this but they&#039;ll
05:42
believe as when we go talk to them
05:44
they&#039;ll change their minds just like
05:44
that and I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s anybody
05:46
out there who can think for themselves
05:47
that will believe these these
05:49
allegations are inning anyway credible
05:51
no they haven&#039;t and that&#039;s that&#039;s the
05:52
good thing in a way I think this is all
05:54
kicked off after our infiltration
05:55
special because what the comments that
05:58
were put underneath that on the YouTube
05:59
video are very very interesting because
06:02
the people&#039;s voice and have a look on
06:03
the winners on the world infiltration
06:05
special underneath you get every single
06:07
technique that was written it&#039;s in these
06:09
documents so obvious I did was post a
06:11
link to the documents and said and for
06:13
anyone who wonders what these rather
06:15
obnoxious and strange comments are take
06:18
a look at this and always you have to do
06:19
is click on the document and they&#039;ll see
06:21
oh this is the handbook and I think
06:23
that&#039;s what they don&#039;t like that&#039;s why
06:25
they&#039;ve had to counter-attack so they&#039;ve
06:26
now said our website was brought down
06:28
coincidentally it&#039;s great it goes tpv
06:31
fans and tpv fans
06:33
yeah there&#039;s on the TPP forum who do you
06:35
think lucky windows really works for it
06:39
says Tony&#039;s dead a missed seven visited
06:41
TPP and discussed her story with
06:42
like this and all the members who had a
06:45
very warm welcome which is totally
06:46
untrue
06:47
Tony Zed posted a copy of his
06:48
complimentary email on his website
06:50
thanking TPP volunteers and staff
06:53
however the following day marked Windows
06:55
in capital letters this is what they do
06:58
think they shout that they and then
06:59
they&#039;ll put underneath something like
07:01
racist or fascist so people just see the
07:03
three things and they go oh my windows
07:04
register
07:05
yeah it&#039;s a cone you a linguistic probe
07:08
but nevertheless that&#039;s what they&#039;re
07:10
doing they try to associate your name
07:11
with something like racism or whatever
07:13
is a classic technique yeah however the
07:15
following day marked windows posted a
07:17
very negative account of their visit on
07:18
his Facebook page even though it never
07:20
witnessed or been present at the meeting
07:21
well obviously I didn&#039;t do that and in
07:24
it says the second story was never aired
07:25
on TPP and Mart windows quickly removed
07:27
his de flama tree comments I&#039;ve got is a
07:29
new word the other new word they divide
07:31
me word out there in DC executable D
07:34
flama tree watch out for that was a
07:35
combination of inflammatory and it&#039;s got
07:38
but not before they were copied for
07:41
evidence little smiley okay so he says
07:45
curiously the synchronicity calm website
07:48
where Tony Z had posted details of the
07:50
TPP visit a missed seven story with Tony
07:52
Farrell videos was viciously hacked and
07:54
taken offline was this just a strange
07:56
coincidence or evidence of deliberate
07:57
verbal attacks intentional hacking by
07:59
despicable New World Order agents using
08:02
asked of hacking them or what I mean I
08:04
think they took their psyche down to his
08:05
yes yeah they rather took it down or
08:07
it&#039;s a classic thing isn&#039;t it the other
08:08
side will do that there&#039;s nothing better
08:10
when we were doing the IRA for one of
08:11
our agents to spend a bit of time in
08:13
prison to give him credibility with the
08:14
IRA it&#039;s a bit like that you subject to
08:17
a denial of service attack people who
08:18
don&#039;t really think things through think
08:20
oh they must be on the although outside
08:21
because they&#039;ve been hacked but it&#039;s
08:22
just a veneer basically it&#039;s again it&#039;s
08:24
a completely false flag operation yeah
08:26
who do you think this scumbag
08:27
Nucky windows really works and then it&#039;s
08:30
copy the link to this so this this story
08:33
that they&#039;ve written which is it goes on
08:35
for pages and it&#039;s allegedly yes so
08:38
let&#039;s be clear about what Charles seven
08:39
is saying is woman she is actually
08:41
saying essentially that seven seven was
08:44
carried out to cover up the fact that
08:47
the BBC stole Strictly Come Dancing
08:50
offer and she was going to be able to
08:52
successfully sue them for that yes many
08:54
other shows the radio show
08:56
born she is actually labelling top
08:59
lawyers in this country yeah and whose
09:01
speciality at law is internet libel so
09:03
she&#039;s liable libel people on the
09:05
internet getting us took trying to get
09:07
it trying to coerce us to libel P people
09:09
whose speciality at law is internet
09:12
libel it seems to be that there&#039;s a
09:14
whole network of these people working
09:16
together but there&#039;s not that many of
09:17
them and it&#039;s they&#039;re turning up
09:19
everything from gatherings on UFOs to
09:22
try and infiltrate people who are
09:23
fighting the CSA yeah absolutely
09:26
it doesn&#039;t need many of them that&#039;s the
09:27
point because it&#039;s a you go into any
09:29
group and you&#039;ll find small-minded
09:30
people don&#039;t care what that group is
09:32
they&#039;ll always attract small-minded
09:33
people that&#039;s the nature of group
09:34
consciousness so it doesn&#039;t need many of
09:36
them to create massive disruption as I
09:38
say without that 9/11 thing I when I was
09:40
they say got felt like the 9/11 truth
09:42
movement I don&#039;t think that all those
09:45
people involved that were working for
09:46
the other side I think there was a one
09:48
or two people are working for the other
09:49
side who were stoking it up but they
09:51
relied upon the stupidity of other
09:52
people when I say stupidity I&#039;m not
09:54
talking about people who are uneducated
09:55
here what I&#039;m talking about is a
09:57
particular type of quite often academic
09:59
stupidity I mean Annie got involved in
10:01
you know taking action against me in
10:02
9/11 and she&#039;s got degree from Cambridge
10:04
University well basically that&#039;s not
10:07
necessarily a sign of intelligence
10:08
that&#039;s what I mean ya know that&#039;s people
10:10
being trained to think in a particular
10:11
way by public school and Oxbridge but
10:14
they&#039;re not free things but they think
10:16
they&#039;re free thinkers they don&#039;t know
10:17
they&#039;ve been sent as a great mind
10:18
control actually I&#039;ve known quite a few
10:20
of them but they make very good
10:21
politician I can&#039;t just tell your story
10:23
as well about something so about four
10:24
minutes left alright quick straw man
10:26
thing is this happened to me when I was
10:27
involved look at the Diana thing and
10:29
Mohamed al-fayed they did something very
10:31
similar there when they offered to
10:32
selling fake documents for twenty
10:34
million dollars I would be able to show
10:35
those documents with faith but that&#039;s
10:37
another technique they use they&#039;ll give
10:38
you some information that looks reliable
10:40
you go make a big song and dance about
10:41
it and then suddenly they come in and
10:43
say no this is all refutable we can
10:45
prove that this is all nonsense so we
10:46
actually good information does emerge
10:48
they then point back to that and say oh
10:50
it&#039;s just more rubbish basically so
10:52
that&#039;s another part of this technique
10:53
they&#039;re using the techniques of just the
10:57
same everywhere they just use the hand
10:58
book which is great and anyone can look
11:00
at this it&#039;s a GCHQ document arts on
11:02
21st century wire and it&#039;s called
11:04
training guide for GCHQ NSA agents
11:06
infiltrating and distributing
11:08
alternative media online there
11:09
is really worth looking that up yeah now
11:12
in this case now clearly Charles seven
11:14
cannot have all the marbles she&#039;s
11:16
clearly got some psychological problems
11:18
if she thinks 77 was carried out to shut
11:20
her up essentially so what we have here
11:22
is the other side using somebody who is
11:26
suffering mental illness to try and
11:28
advance their operation now how sick
11:30
does that get what sort of morals have
11:32
you got when you use somebody who is
11:35
mentally impaired and just to be able to
11:37
put forward your ideas and split up
11:39
somebody who&#039;s telling the truth that&#039;s
11:40
how sick he is she&#039;s a wonderful woman
11:42
who needs protection not to be exploited
11:45
by nasty people from the 9/11 truth move
11:47
and so on who are using it for their own
11:49
ends to try and disrupt what we&#039;re doing
11:51
and then the timing is absolutely
11:53
impeccable because I know that the
11:54
station is at the moment asking for more
11:56
donations this is coming out to go it to
11:58
people as they look the station&#039;s full
12:00
of races don&#039;t give them any money and
12:01
that&#039;s again you cut people off it&#039;s
12:03
sourced and they&#039;ve got no money this
12:04
happy cuz everybody in this country now
12:06
is at risk if you&#039;ve got a small
12:08
business and you maybe have problems
12:10
with the local council they&#039;ll do this
12:12
to you I know people who&#039;s happened to
12:13
so it&#039;s not it&#039;s not just people who
12:15
were trying to investigative journalists
12:17
like us it&#039;s people in business trying
12:19
to make a living their own government
12:21
but is sending people in to destroy them
12:23
it&#039;s an absolute disgrace that&#039;s what I
12:26
said to people years ago about invasions
12:27
of privacy I say you know you may not
12:29
actually have thought out the
12:30
implications of this but one day you&#039;ll
12:32
get into conflict caps of the local
12:33
council and they will use embarrassing
12:35
private information that they glean from
12:38
elsewhere to try and discredit you in
12:39
any court cases credit you publicly
12:41
which is what they&#039;re doing they&#039;re
12:43
doing this here at Wednesday we&#039;re going
12:44
to have to rap now but to all those who
12:47
want to bring down the people&#039;s voice
12:48
and attack investigative journalists
12:50
like myself will be keeping watching
12:52
those watching us watching the People&#039;s
12:55
Voice thanks for listening]]></description>

welcome to windows on the world extra or<br />
00:10<br />
show an infiltration and the paid agents<br />
00:12<br />
who discredit and attack researchers in<br />
00:14<br />
alternative media seem to have had some<br />
00:16<br />
effect the YouTube video of it attracted<br />
00:19<br />
some interesting and predictable<br />
00:20<br />
comments there has also been a further<br />
00:22<br />
attack on myself on the tpv forum this<br />
00:25<br />
is very timely as the documents have<br />
00:27<br />
been released on how government is<br />
00:29<br />
paying people to attack anyone not<br />
00:31<br />
spouting state propaganda as we also<br />
00:33<br />
revealed the fake stories are being<br />
00:36<br />
peddled to discredit and entrap<br />
00:38<br />
researchers and groups who are capable<br />
00:40<br />
of real investigative journalism I&#8217;m<br />
00:42<br />
with David Shayler ex mi5 officer and<br />
00:45<br />
whistleblower to discuss this and what<br />
00:47<br />
we can do about it and it&#8217;s a training<br />
00:49<br />
guide for GCHQ and NSA ages on<br />
00:52<br />
infiltrating and disrupting alternative<br />
00:55<br />
media online the four days are deny<br />
00:57<br />
disrupt degrade and deceive this is<br />
01:01<br />
known as online covert action something<br />
01:04<br />
appeared on the TPP forum a few days ago<br />
01:08<br />
and we were already attacked by these<br />
01:10<br />
people and it&#8217;s very it&#8217;s a very<br />
01:12<br />
interesting as an example of exactly<br />
01:14<br />
what they&#8217;re talking about in the<br />
01:15<br />
document these people don&#8217;t seem to have<br />
01:17<br />
an imagination they just seem to work to<br />
01:19<br />
a rule book so another way most of it is<br />
01:21<br />
reversal isn&#8217;t it yeah well the fact you<br />
01:24<br />
say they work to a rule book is that&#8217;s<br />
01:25<br />
how the opposition work they they almost<br />
01:27<br />
literally have a handbook about how they<br />
01:29<br />
deal with each aspect of protest or<br />
01:31<br />
rebellion or whatever else and and they<br />
01:33<br />
don&#8217;t like departing from the rules<br />
01:35<br />
because they work in a very hierarchical<br />
01:37<br />
construction if you lower down the<br />
01:38<br />
structure you depart from the rules<br />
01:39<br />
you&#8217;re gonna get in trouble with the<br />
01:41<br />
people higher up even if what you do<br />
01:42<br />
works you know so they are following the<br />
01:44<br />
rulebook and the rulebook says yes as<br />
01:46<br />
you say the four DS and those you know<br />
01:48<br />
say this is what it&#8217;s all about you know<br />
01:50<br />
Chapman pinch wrote a book about<br />
01:52<br />
intelligence services called their trade<br />
01:54<br />
is treachery and this is what this is<br />
01:56<br />
what the intelligence says about their<br />
01:57<br />
not about protecting you because the<br />
01:59<br />
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have<br />
02:01<br />
put as it far greater risk that for our<br />
02:03<br />
lives at far greater risk of attack from<br />
02:05<br />
extremists but what they have been doing<br />
02:07<br />
all that time is trying to put out<br />
02:09<br />
misinformation about things like 9/11<br />
02:11<br />
for example so before we talk about this<br />
02:12<br />
case I will say that one of the person<br />
02:14<br />
who was in<br />
02:15<br />
all over this faction we know about was<br />
02:17<br />
also involved in removing me from 9/11<br />
02:20<br />
when we were having enormous success in<br />
02:22<br />
up until early 2007 in many case they&#8217;ve<br />
02:25<br />
work on people&#8217;s small-mindedness rather<br />
02:27<br />
than people actually being prey to the<br />
02:28<br />
operation themselves being partied about<br />
02:30<br />
yes absolutely correct so yes so people<br />
02:32<br />
coming to me attacking me shouting at me<br />
02:34<br />
screaming at me including I say this<br />
02:36<br />
person of the 9/11 truth movement now<br />
02:38<br />
that point the 9/11 truth movement split<br />
02:41<br />
and after that it fell apart it never<br />
02:44<br />
had the same profile because that point<br />
02:45<br />
we were getting on things like the<br />
02:46<br />
Jeremy Vine Show Sky News and the Steven<br />
02:50<br />
Walsh show these are one things with<br />
02:51<br />
millions of viewers basically so that<br />
02:53<br />
was all cut out and I even told these<br />
02:55<br />
people what was going on and they still<br />
02:57<br />
did it so let&#8217;s be clear about this a<br />
02:59<br />
lot of this misinformation relies upon<br />
03:02<br />
what I call the Munchkin mentality those<br />
03:04<br />
twenty to forty percent out of people<br />
03:05<br />
out there who act like the herd can&#8217;t<br />
03:07<br />
think for themselves and I&#8217;ve seen those<br />
03:09<br />
people in their eyes go it&#8217;s frightening<br />
03:10<br />
because you they lose the connection<br />
03:12<br />
with their soul basically and that one<br />
03:14<br />
thing explains how we have communist<br />
03:17<br />
Russia Nazi Germany every atrocity in<br />
03:19<br />
the world is carried out by groups<br />
03:21<br />
who&#8217;ve lost their connection to their<br />
03:23<br />
conscience so yeah so that&#8217;s what<br />
03:25<br />
they&#8217;re using and they do have that<br />
03:26<br />
intrinsic understanding of human<br />
03:28<br />
psychology because these people who<br />
03:30<br />
belong to a group can&#8217;t think for<br />
03:31<br />
themselves they will also blacken your<br />
03:33<br />
character by association and that&#8217;s what<br />
03:36<br />
they&#8217;re trying to do here with this<br />
03:36<br />
they&#8217;re trying to accuse us with being<br />
03:38<br />
racists well it&#8217;s yeah how did you say<br />
03:40<br />
about I totally utterly repudiate that I<br />
03:43<br />
have never ever been a racist and people<br />
03:45<br />
will know that by standing up for the<br />
03:47<br />
truth about 9/11 and 7/7 we are pointing<br />
03:50<br />
out the racism of the other side the<br />
03:52<br />
racism of government that blames Muslims<br />
03:54<br />
for the attack on 77 without any sort of<br />
03:56<br />
proper formal inquiry basic they played<br />
03:58<br />
the race card about two years ago and a<br />
03:59<br />
lot of people jumped to my defense which<br />
04:01<br />
was nice but really this stuff shouldn&#8217;t<br />
04:03<br />
have got this far the point is that the<br />
04:06<br />
we&#8217;ve got very lazy people out there and<br />
04:08<br />
people who are working for the<br />
04:09<br />
government get paid a lot of money to<br />
04:11<br />
discredit people like me all is I&#8217;m<br />
04:13<br />
doing is presenting the show where I&#8217;m<br />
04:15<br />
trying to help people from getting<br />
04:16<br />
houses taken off them stuff like that<br />
04:18<br />
now what&#8217;s very insidious about this is<br />
04:20<br />
the fact that they&#8217;ve kept on going on<br />
04:23<br />
me and people around me now I don&#8217;t<br />
04:26<br />
consider myself to be a threat to the<br />
04:28<br />
Nationals<br />
04:28<br />
these people in my opinion our total<br />
04:31<br />
traitors to this country everything that<br />
04:33<br />
Britain is about no absolutely but the<br />
04:35<br />
problem is is they use a very perverse<br />
04:37<br />
definition of national security there&#8217;s<br />
04:39<br />
insecurity in the sense of the<br />
04:40<br />
collateral for a loan so they&#8217;re talking<br />
04:42<br />
about the financing of the country now<br />
04:44<br />
you know I be virtually anything we do<br />
04:45<br />
because it exposes this is therefore it<br />
04:48<br />
not in the interests of national<br />
04:49<br />
security in that sense however if we<br />
04:52<br />
were to talk about the broader interests<br />
04:53<br />
of the nation of course this works in<br />
04:55<br />
the interest of the nation it&#8217;s not in<br />
04:56<br />
the interests of any country to live<br />
04:58<br />
under a regime that puts out propaganda<br />
05:00<br />
and lies it&#8217;s not on the interests of<br />
05:02<br />
any country for a government to go<br />
05:04<br />
around oppressing the rights not just of<br />
05:06<br />
its own people obviously people are free<br />
05:07<br />
across the world where we&#8217;ve invaded<br />
05:09<br />
countries so we are standing up for the<br />
05:11<br />
what&#8217;s called a common good under the<br />
05:13<br />
under the common law and that&#8217;s a phrase<br />
05:15<br />
that can&#8217;t be perverted national<br />
05:16<br />
interest national security have<br />
05:17<br />
different meanings in Babylon that we<br />
05:19<br />
stand up for the common good essentially<br />
05:21<br />
and I think it&#8217;s enormously suspicious<br />
05:23<br />
this is happening now Marc because as<br />
05:24<br />
you know people&#8217;s voices starting to<br />
05:26<br />
take off your show starting to take off<br />
05:28<br />
I&#8217;m returning to having more of a public<br />
05:30<br />
profile so this is an attempt to try and<br />
05:32<br />
cut us off at the past and stop that<br />
05:34<br />
happening basically now obviously we<br />
05:36<br />
rely upon the good sense of people out<br />
05:38<br />
there of course the 20 or 40 percent or<br />
05:40<br />
munchkins will believe this but they&#8217;ll<br />
05:42<br />
believe as when we go talk to them<br />
05:44<br />
they&#8217;ll change their minds just like<br />
05:44<br />
that and I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s anybody<br />
05:46<br />
out there who can think for themselves<br />
05:47<br />
that will believe these these<br />
05:49<br />
allegations are inning anyway credible<br />
05:51<br />
no they haven&#8217;t and that&#8217;s that&#8217;s the<br />
05:52<br />
good thing in a way I think this is all<br />
05:54<br />
kicked off after our infiltration<br />
05:55<br />
special because what the comments that<br />
05:58<br />
were put underneath that on the YouTube<br />
05:59<br />
video are very very interesting because<br />
06:02<br />
the people&#8217;s voice and have a look on<br />
06:03<br />
the winners on the world infiltration<br />
06:05<br />
special underneath you get every single<br />
06:07<br />
technique that was written it&#8217;s in these<br />
06:09<br />
documents so obvious I did was post a<br />
06:11<br />
link to the documents and said and for<br />
06:13<br />
anyone who wonders what these rather<br />
06:15<br />
obnoxious and strange comments are take<br />
06:18<br />
a look at this and always you have to do<br />
06:19<br />
is click on the document and they&#8217;ll see<br />
06:21<br />
oh this is the handbook and I think<br />
06:23<br />
that&#8217;s what they don&#8217;t like that&#8217;s why<br />
06:25<br />
they&#8217;ve had to counter-attack so they&#8217;ve<br />
06:26<br />
now said our website was brought down<br />
06:28<br />
coincidentally it&#8217;s great it goes tpv<br />
06:31<br />
fans and tpv fans<br />
06:33<br />
yeah there&#8217;s on the TPP forum who do you<br />
06:35<br />
think lucky windows really works for it<br />
06:39<br />
says Tony&#8217;s dead a missed seven visited<br />
06:41<br />
TPP and discussed her story with<br />
06:42<br />
like this and all the members who had a<br />
06:45<br />
very warm welcome which is totally<br />
06:46<br />
untrue<br />
06:47<br />
Tony Zed posted a copy of his<br />
06:48<br />
complimentary email on his website<br />
06:50<br />
thanking TPP volunteers and staff<br />
06:53<br />
however the following day marked Windows<br />
06:55<br />
in capital letters this is what they do<br />
06:58<br />
think they shout that they and then<br />
06:59<br />
they&#8217;ll put underneath something like<br />
07:01<br />
racist or fascist so people just see the<br />
07:03<br />
three things and they go oh my windows<br />
07:04<br />
register<br />
07:05<br />
yeah it&#8217;s a cone you a linguistic probe<br />
07:08<br />
but nevertheless that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re<br />
07:10<br />
doing they try to associate your name<br />
07:11<br />
with something like racism or whatever<br />
07:13<br />
is a classic technique yeah however the<br />
07:15<br />
following day marked windows posted a<br />
07:17<br />
very negative account of their visit on<br />
07:18<br />
his Facebook page even though it never<br />
07:20<br />
witnessed or been present at the meeting<br />
07:21<br />
well obviously I didn&#8217;t do that and in<br />
07:24<br />
it says the second story was never aired<br />
07:25<br />
on TPP and Mart windows quickly removed<br />
07:27<br />
his de flama tree comments I&#8217;ve got is a<br />
07:29<br />
new word the other new word they divide<br />
07:31<br />
me word out there in DC executable D<br />
07:34<br />
flama tree watch out for that was a<br />
07:35<br />
combination of inflammatory and it&#8217;s got<br />
07:38<br />
but not before they were copied for<br />
07:41<br />
evidence little smiley okay so he says<br />
07:45<br />
curiously the synchronicity calm website<br />
07:48<br />
where Tony Z had posted details of the<br />
07:50<br />
TPP visit a missed seven story with Tony<br />
07:52<br />
Farrell videos was viciously hacked and<br />
07:54<br />
taken offline was this just a strange<br />
07:56<br />
coincidence or evidence of deliberate<br />
07:57<br />
verbal attacks intentional hacking by<br />
07:59<br />
despicable New World Order agents using<br />
08:02<br />
asked of hacking them or what I mean I<br />
08:04<br />
think they took their psyche down to his<br />
08:05<br />
yes yeah they rather took it down or<br />
08:07<br />
it&#8217;s a classic thing isn&#8217;t it the other<br />
08:08<br />
side will do that there&#8217;s nothing better<br />
08:10<br />
when we were doing the IRA for one of<br />
08:11<br />
our agents to spend a bit of time in<br />
08:13<br />
prison to give him credibility with the<br />
08:14<br />
IRA it&#8217;s a bit like that you subject to<br />
08:17<br />
a denial of service attack people who<br />
08:18<br />
don&#8217;t really think things through think<br />
08:20<br />
oh they must be on the although outside<br />
08:21<br />
because they&#8217;ve been hacked but it&#8217;s<br />
08:22<br />
just a veneer basically it&#8217;s again it&#8217;s<br />
08:24<br />
a completely false flag operation yeah<br />
08:26<br />
who do you think this scumbag<br />
08:27<br />
Nucky windows really works and then it&#8217;s<br />
08:30<br />
copy the link to this so this this story<br />
08:33<br />
that they&#8217;ve written which is it goes on<br />
08:35<br />
for pages and it&#8217;s allegedly yes so<br />
08:38<br />
let&#8217;s be clear about what Charles seven<br />
08:39<br />
is saying is woman she is actually<br />
08:41<br />
saying essentially that seven seven was<br />
08:44<br />
carried out to cover up the fact that<br />
08:47<br />
the BBC stole Strictly Come Dancing<br />
08:50<br />
offer and she was going to be able to<br />
08:52<br />
successfully sue them for that yes many<br />
08:54<br />
other shows the radio show<br />
08:56<br />
born she is actually labelling top<br />
08:59<br />
lawyers in this country yeah and whose<br />
09:01<br />
speciality at law is internet libel so<br />
09:03<br />
she&#8217;s liable libel people on the<br />
09:05<br />
internet getting us took trying to get<br />
09:07<br />
it trying to coerce us to libel P people<br />
09:09<br />
whose speciality at law is internet<br />
09:12<br />
libel it seems to be that there&#8217;s a<br />
09:14<br />
whole network of these people working<br />
09:16<br />
together but there&#8217;s not that many of<br />
09:17<br />
them and it&#8217;s they&#8217;re turning up<br />
09:19<br />
everything from gatherings on UFOs to<br />
09:22<br />
try and infiltrate people who are<br />
09:23<br />
fighting the CSA yeah absolutely<br />
09:26<br />
it doesn&#8217;t need many of them that&#8217;s the<br />
09:27<br />
point because it&#8217;s a you go into any<br />
09:29<br />
group and you&#8217;ll find small-minded<br />
09:30<br />
people don&#8217;t care what that group is<br />
09:32<br />
they&#8217;ll always attract small-minded<br />
09:33<br />
people that&#8217;s the nature of group<br />
09:34<br />
consciousness so it doesn&#8217;t need many of<br />
09:36<br />
them to create massive disruption as I<br />
09:38<br />
say without that 9/11 thing I when I was<br />
09:40<br />
they say got felt like the 9/11 truth<br />
09:42<br />
movement I don&#8217;t think that all those<br />
09:45<br />
people involved that were working for<br />
09:46<br />
the other side I think there was a one<br />
09:48<br />
or two people are working for the other<br />
09:49<br />
side who were stoking it up but they<br />
09:51<br />
relied upon the stupidity of other<br />
09:52<br />
people when I say stupidity I&#8217;m not<br />
09:54<br />
talking about people who are uneducated<br />
09:55<br />
here what I&#8217;m talking about is a<br />
09:57<br />
particular type of quite often academic<br />
09:59<br />
stupidity I mean Annie got involved in<br />
10:01<br />
you know taking action against me in<br />
10:02<br />
9/11 and she&#8217;s got degree from Cambridge<br />
10:04<br />
University well basically that&#8217;s not<br />
10:07<br />
necessarily a sign of intelligence<br />
10:08<br />
that&#8217;s what I mean ya know that&#8217;s people<br />
10:10<br />
being trained to think in a particular<br />
10:11<br />
way by public school and Oxbridge but<br />
10:14<br />
they&#8217;re not free things but they think<br />
10:16<br />
they&#8217;re free thinkers they don&#8217;t know<br />
10:17<br />
they&#8217;ve been sent as a great mind<br />
10:18<br />
control actually I&#8217;ve known quite a few<br />
10:20<br />
of them but they make very good<br />
10:21<br />
politician I can&#8217;t just tell your story<br />
10:23<br />
as well about something so about four<br />
10:24<br />
minutes left alright quick straw man<br />
10:26<br />
thing is this happened to me when I was<br />
10:27<br />
involved look at the Diana thing and<br />
10:29<br />
Mohamed al-fayed they did something very<br />
10:31<br />
similar there when they offered to<br />
10:32<br />
selling fake documents for twenty<br />
10:34<br />
million dollars I would be able to show<br />
10:35<br />
those documents with faith but that&#8217;s<br />
10:37<br />
another technique they use they&#8217;ll give<br />
10:38<br />
you some information that looks reliable<br />
10:40<br />
you go make a big song and dance about<br />
10:41<br />
it and then suddenly they come in and<br />
10:43<br />
say no this is all refutable we can<br />
10:45<br />
prove that this is all nonsense so we<br />
10:46<br />
actually good information does emerge<br />
10:48<br />
they then point back to that and say oh<br />
10:50<br />
it&#8217;s just more rubbish basically so<br />
10:52<br />
that&#8217;s another part of this technique<br />
10:53<br />
they&#8217;re using the techniques of just the<br />
10:57<br />
same everywhere they just use the hand<br />
10:58<br />
book which is great and anyone can look<br />
11:00<br />
at this it&#8217;s a GCHQ document arts on<br />
11:02<br />
21st century wire and it&#8217;s called<br />
11:04<br />
training guide for GCHQ NSA agents<br />
11:06<br />
infiltrating and distributing<br />
11:08<br />
alternative media online there<br />
11:09<br />
is really worth looking that up yeah now<br />
11:12<br />
in this case now clearly Charles seven<br />
11:14<br />
cannot have all the marbles she&#8217;s<br />
11:16<br />
clearly got some psychological problems<br />
11:18<br />
if she thinks 77 was carried out to shut<br />
11:20<br />
her up essentially so what we have here<br />
11:22<br />
is the other side using somebody who is<br />
11:26<br />
suffering mental illness to try and<br />
11:28<br />
advance their operation now how sick<br />
11:30<br />
does that get what sort of morals have<br />
11:32<br />
you got when you use somebody who is<br />
11:35<br />
mentally impaired and just to be able to<br />
11:37<br />
put forward your ideas and split up<br />
11:39<br />
somebody who&#8217;s telling the truth that&#8217;s<br />
11:40<br />
how sick he is she&#8217;s a wonderful woman<br />
11:42<br />
who needs protection not to be exploited<br />
11:45<br />
by nasty people from the 9/11 truth move<br />
11:47<br />
and so on who are using it for their own<br />
11:49<br />
ends to try and disrupt what we&#8217;re doing<br />
11:51<br />
and then the timing is absolutely<br />
11:53<br />
impeccable because I know that the<br />
11:54<br />
station is at the moment asking for more<br />
11:56<br />
donations this is coming out to go it to<br />
11:58<br />
people as they look the station&#8217;s full<br />
12:00<br />
of races don&#8217;t give them any money and<br />
12:01<br />
that&#8217;s again you cut people off it&#8217;s<br />
12:03<br />
sourced and they&#8217;ve got no money this<br />
12:04<br />
happy cuz everybody in this country now<br />
12:06<br />
is at risk if you&#8217;ve got a small<br />
12:08<br />
business and you maybe have problems<br />
12:10<br />
with the local council they&#8217;ll do this<br />
12:12<br />
to you I know people who&#8217;s happened to<br />
12:13<br />
so it&#8217;s not it&#8217;s not just people who<br />
12:15<br />
were trying to investigative journalists<br />
12:17<br />
like us it&#8217;s people in business trying<br />
12:19<br />
to make a living their own government<br />
12:21<br />
but is sending people in to destroy them<br />
12:23<br />
it&#8217;s an absolute disgrace that&#8217;s what I<br />
12:26<br />
said to people years ago about invasions<br />
12:27<br />
of privacy I say you know you may not<br />
12:29<br />
actually have thought out the<br />
12:30<br />
implications of this but one day you&#8217;ll<br />
12:32<br />
get into conflict caps of the local<br />
12:33<br />
council and they will use embarrassing<br />
12:35<br />
private information that they glean from<br />
12:38<br />
elsewhere to try and discredit you in<br />
12:39<br />
any court cases credit you publicly<br />
12:41<br />
which is what they&#8217;re doing they&#8217;re<br />
12:43<br />
doing this here at Wednesday we&#8217;re going<br />
12:44<br />
to have to rap now but to all those who<br />
12:47<br />
want to bring down the people&#8217;s voice<br />
12:48<br />
and attack investigative journalists<br />
12:50<br />
like myself will be keeping watching<br />
12:52<br />
those watching us watching the People&#8217;s<br />
12:55<br />
Voice thanks for listening</p>
