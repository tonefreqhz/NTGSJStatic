Bradley Potter, Johns Hopkins University SAIS    http://www.classicsofstrategy.com/2016/02/henry-kissinger-a-world-restored-1957.html   Meanwhile, Castlereagh was the “authentically tragic statesman” trying to get the best for his country abroad, but struggling all the same against timeless, confounding domestic forces (Ferguson 2015, 303). His long study of Metternich and Castlereagh must have affected Kissinger’s development as a policymaker, but what his dissertation really offered him was a laboratory to explore how these practitioners engaged in foreign policy realism. It would be as a realist that Kissinger would make his first-hand mark on the conduct of international affairs (Kaplan 1999). Realism certainly became his creed. Its counterpoint, idealism, in his view had failed repeatedly throughout American history and served only to cause an “inefficient cycle of intense hope and activity abroad followed by morose withdrawal once it became apparent that hope and activity were unlikely to remake the world” (Kaplan 1999).  This is the original Post I did on Lance De Havens Work on State Crimes against democracy, they do happen and do get memory-holed. I make no comment on Sandy Hook, The murder of innocents is tragic and as an Allegory of the sickness of the political disrepute and moral degeneration of the political class within the Washington Consensus both sides of the Atlantic, Sandy Hook is a charge sheet against the failure of institutions much more than a reflection of the people. A fish rots from the head and the Picture of Sandy Hook which-ever way one wishes to interpret it paints how rotten the Head of our polity has become. Lance Dehaven calls Government Conspiracies when they are to be investigated State Crimes against democracy, Or SCADS.  http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2016/10/hangin-scads.html  Article 21 of the United Nation&#8217;s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &#8220;The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government&#8221;. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed   No one has any business stealing elections. Shutting down minority voices or voices of dissent by the main Stream media is another not so subtle way of vote rigging. Rigging of the mechanical process and arithmetical integrity of votes actually cast has happened in recent US elections, it happened on a huge scale in the New York and California Democratic primaries this year, in the suppression of support for Bernie Sanders. If all is fair in love and war and if the Republican Tammany machine were at the disposal of Mr. Trump perhaps we could just enjoy the spectacle in World Wide Wrestlings best traditions of flouting the rules and blind siding the referee. Mr. Trump does not have the Republican machine in his corner, so has no one to tag? that&#8217;s, not a fair fight even a fight where the unwritten rule is that the rules are supposed to be broken?   Domhoff.  Who Rules America? is a book by research psychologist and sociologist, G. William Domhoff, Ph.D., first published in 1967 as a best-seller (#12), with six subsequent editions including Who Rules America Now? (1983, #43), Who Rules America? Challenges to Corporate and Class Dominance (2009), Who Rules America? Power and Politics (2013), Who Rules America? The Triumph of the Corporate Rich (2013), and the forthcoming, Studying the Power Elite: Fifty Years of Who Rules America (2017).[1] It is frequently assigned as a sociology textbook and argues against the concentration of power and wealth in the American upper class.[2] The 2010 edition[clarification needed] brings the discussion up to date and also includes the rise of Barack Obama, his campaign finance supporters, and the nature of his administration. Domhoff argues in the book that a power elite wields power in America through its support of think-tanks, foundations, commissions, and academic departments.[3] Additionally, he argues that the elite controls institutions through overt authority, not through covert influence.[4] In his introduction, Domhoff writes that the book was inspired by the work of four men: sociologists E. Digby Baltzell, C. Wright Mills, economist Paul Sweezy, and political scientist Robert A. Dahl.[5] The University of California, Santa Cruz hosts his online summary collection, also titled &#8220;Who Rules America?&#8221;[6] . This is a very good report summarising the position of the so called insurgent anti-European Union, Anti Immigration parties in the EU area. Both from the left and the right of the political spectrum. Left and Right seems a weak measure these days the distinction, I would argue, is that of Centralised Globalist Command and control Corporate Fascism against a decentralised more federalist approach honoring the subsidiarity of National Social contracts and political settlements from the post Second World war era in Europe and the USA. The Horrors of Sykes Picot ( post 1st WW1 and the Stalin,  Roosevelt Churchill, carve ups of the world along colonial lines  http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_world_according_to_europes_insurgent_parties7055  4. Merkel’s ‘refugees welcome’ policy is not widely blamed as the cause of the migration crisis: only seven parties named it in their top two explanations for the Crisis. US strategy in the Middle East was the most popular answer, with President Assad’s regime sponsored violence in Syria in second place in the responses given.  7. There is scepticism around future European or US interventionism generally, particularly in the Middle East, from Sinn Fein in Ireland, to UKIP in the UK, to the Front National and the Communist Party in France, to AFD and Die Linke in Germany, to Jobbik in Hungary and the Five Star Movement in Italy.  These parties are likely to bolster the intervention fatigue trend in EU foreign policy over coming years, making it even more difficult for national governments to sell the idea of future military deployment to their populations. 8.  Despite differences between the parties, there was consensus in the external threats faced by the EU.  For 36 out of the 45 parties covered, the refugee crisis or the threat of terrorism and radical Islamism (these issues were inextricably linked in the responses that the majority of parties gave) represented the top or top two priorities for the EU. This response was not the preserve of the right wing: Die Linke in Germany; the French Communist Party, Podemos in Spain, and the Lithuanian Labour Party were also among those who voted in this way. 9. Suspicions among these parties about the transatlantic relationship are partly fuelled by opposition to the Transatlantic Trade Treaty (TTIP), with 26 out of the parties arguing that the EU should not conclude a TTIP with the US at all. But there were some notable exceptions including the Sweden Democrats; Danish People’s Party, the Finns Party, Estonia Party of People’s Unity, ALFA in Germany, Syriza and Independent Greeks who saw the potential for it to be positive under the right conditions.  https://isgp-studies.com/liberal-cia-immigration  https://isgp-studies.com/liberal-cia-immigration [&#8230;]]]></description>
