					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The key here is to understand that Austerity is a choice made in Political Economy and conferring residency status and the rights of a British Subject (we are subjects, not citizens) onto EU citizens resident in the UK are socio-political choices. https://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/&#8230;/socrati&#8230; There is no evidence that the UK Government even this May Government which is much more neo-liberal than it is Tory, will have any worse chance of making an egalitarian and fair and just decision regarding EU citizens rights than the EU Commission will propose for a rubber stamp from the EU Parliament.
