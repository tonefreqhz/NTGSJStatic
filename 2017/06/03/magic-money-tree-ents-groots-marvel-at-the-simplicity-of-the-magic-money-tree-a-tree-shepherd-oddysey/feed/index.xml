					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] @John Ellis, Mr Ellis, Your condecension is wholly commensurate with the scale of your Arrogant Ignorance. Let me ask you this, What is Money. If you know the answer to that question try this one one as well. Is it wise to measure anything with a Variable Ruler?FInanlly may I suggest that you are within a category ably described by John Ruskin in Unto this last Thus.&#8220;Pardon me. Men of business do indeed know how they themselvesmade their money, or how, on occasion, they lost it. Playing athe long-practised game, they are familiar with the chances of itscards, and can rightly explain their losses and gains. But theyneither know who keeps the bank of the gambling-house nor whatother games may be played with the same cards, nor what otherlosses and gains, far away among the dark streets, areessentially, though invisibly, dependent on theirs in the lightedrooms. They have learned a few, and only a few, of the laws ofmercantile economy; but not one of those of political economy.&#8221;And a little poem to help you along your Way Mr Ellis.http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2017/06/magic-money-tree-ents-groots-marvel-at.html [&#8230;]]]></description>
