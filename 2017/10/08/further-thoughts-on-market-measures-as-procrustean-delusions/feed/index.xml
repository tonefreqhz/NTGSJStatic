					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] From the cover piece blurb. “Bruce Charlton argues that political correctness is an objectively totalitarian ideology that has created an environment of fear among the intellectual leadership with ranging from social ostracism, through, financial penalties and loss of employment, up to credible threats of violence and imprisonment. Consequently, Western elites have internalized the constraints of political correctness, so that its lies, shabbiness and wickedness now permeate our very thought processes”. * He also goes on to say this about Outcomes under PC regimes. https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2017/10/08/further-thoughts-on-market-measures-as-procrustea&#8230; [&#8230;]]]></description>
