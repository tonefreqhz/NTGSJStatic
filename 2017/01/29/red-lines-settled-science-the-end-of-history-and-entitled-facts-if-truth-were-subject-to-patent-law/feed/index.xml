					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The Cult of Personality, The Cult of the Corporation. The Cult of Brands.  If Mac Donalds was a worker´s cooperative how would that transfer Global Brand.  when the discourse is reduced to a binary raspberry contest the Establishment&#8217;s budget will always end up blowing the biggest Raspberry. Social Media is very powerful but also very fragmented outside of the Monopolised entry points. The folk caught up at the turnstiles will not drill down into any meaningful discourse and the web has been tied up very well that way with the rise of Google and Facebook. Subsets of the two do allow for communities of serious discussion to emerge but the shell game there is to stop the communities from joining up their discourse and leveraging their smaller Audiences. Audience leverage is a question of appealing to a crossover style of argumentation. One should give both sides or the story an authentically given right of reply to all the arguments from the different sides of the story. Ultimately it is condescending and counterproductive to seek to tell any reader or consumer of information or entertainment what they should make of it.
