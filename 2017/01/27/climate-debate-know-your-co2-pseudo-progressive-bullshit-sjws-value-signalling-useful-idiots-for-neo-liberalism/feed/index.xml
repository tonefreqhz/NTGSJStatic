					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] rogerglewis August 28, 2017 at 10:51 am   Bob, I am not an advocate of subsidising crony capitalists in any industry, whether it be energy production or Banking. Oaklahoma made the right decision , schools are way more important an investment in the future to trash for some political hobby horse. The wider question about EROI in society is well set out in this paper. https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/energy-policy_Lambert_et.al_2013.pdf “There is evidence too that once payments for energy rise above a certain threshold at the national level (e.g. approximately 10 percent in the United States) that economic recessions follow (Hamilton, 2009; Hall et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2011). Despite the best intentions of improving net energy balances for a developing nation, the large-scale introduction of renewable energy generation may have too low an EROI and may prove too expensive to facilitate continued growth in developing economies”. The Green Fascists are bonkers, I have argued that case in the UK Green Party for some time, I am not a member but a good friend is, I despise Al Gore too, now he is a fraud I think we could both probably agree on that. Local Government are not able to create their own money supply ( the exception in the USA is the Bank of North Dakota, which as well as having an oil Boom/Bust has had a publicly owned Bank which has assisted that States economy hugely, Ellen Brown has written on that ,https://ellenbrown.com/2016/05/02/bank-of-north-dakota-soars-despite-oil-bust-a-blueprint-for-california/ ) I am a pragmatist of the Old School and think that all objective and Viable energy sources Paotential and current are needed to assist with the economic Development of people across the world according to their own local needs. Sadly US foreign Policy frustrates the wishes of ordinary people all over the world even where they are rich in primary energy sources. This report will give you some idea of my own perspective regarding Debt and the Oil Business. http://priceofoil.org/…/2011/01/DrillingIntoDebt.pdf http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2017/01/climate-debate-know-your-co2-pseudo.html [&#8230;]]]></description>
