					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] My Patreon Pagelink, the process of signing up and creating a page is very easy and I have wondered about it for some time. There are several You Tube channels I watch who are partly funded by Patreon Support.  Heres my Pitch Blurb. We´ll see who would like to read more as I write ( previews of chapters, opportunities to edit and suggest plot twists, that sort of thing ( Yeats is dead, a Novel by Irish Authors is something of the sort, not quite but sort of. .) Meanwhile, I cling to hopes of getting a dead tree publisher someday. I recently joined the Realistic Poetry site and put my Collection of more recent poems into a PDF Book Format to exchange reviews with another poet, it was a very enjoyable experience reading and reviewing the work of another poet. I spent 4 days reading, re-reading and working on my review and await the review of my co-reviewee. Realistic Poetry I have to thank for the PDF, so it will serve well, re-cycled as an early reward. Should I secure some patronage? How very exciting! will it be the Kings Men? or the Admirals men?for me. Will swooning declamations of devotion to my patrons foreword the second Swedish period of my poetical efforts, will I lapse into sophistry Vivian from the young ones would snort at the pecuniary solicitation I am sure. To which here&#8217;s my referral link for which I might even earn commission. Referral Link For Patreon. Vivian is not amused! The Peoples Poet.   I have been Blogging since 2011 and have been making youtube videos since 2009. I have an almost finished first Novel Called The Plantsman which is a satirical comedy novel about how we all have roles in our own lives that caste us variously as dramaticus personae simultaneously or alternately villain, lover &#038; hero, simpleton or wise. My Philosophy studies have lead to a deep intrigue with plurality, being more than one thing at once. These opposing and not always complementary roles we play make for some very funny situations and it is these absurdities I wish to examine and shine light upon. Poking gentle fun at the un-self-knowing pompous selves we all sometimes are. My Second Novel informs the first and I will not be able to finish it until Novel 2 is completed. My Second Novel is Called the Conquest of Dough which is a metaphorical parable about sourdough bread and a legendary Syrian Sourdough that is smuggled to the UK. Here the Syrian refugee meets with challenges, helpers and enemies who seek to restore the Dough to its homeland, various actors wish the Dough to be suppressed. The dough is the metaphor for Money which examines another of my areas of work, Monetary reform activism. The Finale of Conquest of dough is a hilarious romp through the Glastonbury Music Festival, examining the social aspects of that festival. Glastonbury as Parody of itself whilst pretending it remains what it once was. I have a series of epic poems which I wish to pursue after the conquest of Dough around the theme of democracy. What is it? and how is it done? There are various political episodes in my lifetime I wish to satirise in poetry. Epic Poetry is my preferred medium for satirising matters of Political Economy. I am a political animal, a dedicated Anarchist and confirmed tree hugger. I have following the Great Crash of 2008, in stoic parlance, Returned my wealth and live now very simply. I would like to spend most of my time writing and the political nature of much of what I write does not sit well with the Political Climate of conventional Dead tree publishing. I thought I would see if Patreon might be a way to make a contribution to our Family Budget whilst Writing Full time for a Year or so. As my Introduction Video I have linked to my Latest Poem on Brexit, Unwrapping Democracy, The emergent reality of Brexit. This poem Maybe read variously at My Blog and found elsewhere using Hypatias Eyebrowser.,   https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/philosoetry-by-roger-lewis/ [&#8230;]]]></description>
