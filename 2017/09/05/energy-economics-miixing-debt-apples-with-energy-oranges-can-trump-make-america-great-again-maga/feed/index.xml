Thanks. You raise a large number of issues, some of which I’ll need to follow up before I can comment.

Yes, money is ‘loaned into existence’. But, however created, it is still a “claim” on real economic output. If that claim can’t be met then, by definition, it has to be destroyed. This makes its owner – or the creditor to whom it belongs – poorer.

Part of the problem is that money is accepted as a “store of value” – so, if someone owes me $1, I count that as an asset. If he cannot pay me, then I’m $1 ‘poorer’. No-one has yet demonstrated how we can ‘let off’ debtors without leaving creditors short-changed – and these creditors are often debtors to others.

Some engineering solutions might be possible – but we seem unable to find them. For instance, the WEF report on pension shortfalls couldn’t suggest much more than higher savings ratios, which aren’t practicable, as they would need to be far too high to be affordable. Getting returns on investment higher would “solve” the problem, but only by raising interest rates. And so on……..

Hello Tim, Thanks for the reply.
If we are talking about the existing System the problem is one of Assymetric Risk and lack of moral hazard, Taleb has fully examined these questions and This Interview of his I found very useful.

http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2015/07/on-skin-in-game-interestinf-question.html
I was looking at your Seeds report for Greece earlier and the Curves certainly do not point to the huge disaster that has unfolded there in the last 7 years Which is more properly expressed by the curves in this blog http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2015/07/bricks-without-straw-pharoh-merkel.html

The Stock taking point I make is a serious question that needs addressing Both in terms of the existing system but any proposed energy based alternative. Energy Investment Decisions I would argue are better made in local scale up to regional scale levels and not from Supra National down to national levels.It really boils down to a question of Scale and Democracy.

Whether it is Energy Based Exchange Tokens or debt based debt tokens the political question remains the basic one of what is the balance between Subsidiarity and Centralisation a Balance the EU and ECB has badly wrong and which the Fed and US Federal Government have badly wrong and which has also been got badly wrong in the UK,
I live in Sweden where subsidiarity in Local Government is very real it is also true that subsidiarity remains at the core of the Success of Germany. This Interview with Prof Richard Werner is very good on the lessons from the German Model.

Roger:

Thanks. I’m glad you mentioned that download for Greece, as I really need to replace these with new ones. Point taken, though.

You’re right, too, about local decision-making. One implication of renewables is that they change the economics, taking away the economies of scale that have hitherto favoured small numbers of large generating sites. This has been called “utility death syndrome”, and has been discussed here before – and it certainly favours localism.

The UK is extremely centralised, as I know becaise I was a local councillor for quite a few years before I emigrated. British energy policy has been inept, putting off nuclear replacement decisions for far too long, ending up with the hugely expensive Hinkley Point(less) project, and spending vast sums subsidising wind.]]></description>
