The rabbi (the story goes) replied as follows: ‘There are two possible ways, one involving natural means, the other supernatural. The natural means would be if a million angels with flaming swords were to descend on Germany and destroy it. The supernatural would be if a million Englishmen parachuted down on Germany and destroyed it.’ Churchill, being a realist, chose the natural method, angels with flaming swords.
