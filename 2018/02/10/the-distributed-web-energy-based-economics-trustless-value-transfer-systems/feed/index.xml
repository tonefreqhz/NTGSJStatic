					<description><![CDATA[PodStop Pit Stop Cellular Automated Motels

https://longhairedmusings.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/possibilist-perspective-on-post-growth-sustainable-money-and-sustainable-energy-whos-reality/comment-page-1/#comment-519
Hi Stephen I blogged about this around one year ago I hope progress is coming
This site I discovered in some old notes yesterday, revieing some stuff and getting back to finishing #CoquestofDough 
http://paulgrignon.netfirms.com/MoneyasDebt/sitemap.htm

Pauls stuff is very deeply memory holed
This slide show is brilliant
The following is a logical proof, laid out in diagrams and animated flow charts, of what is meant by “Twice-Lent” Money and why this simple but overlooked dynamic is important.
Use the PREVIOUS/NEXT buttons to move through the slides at your own pace. roll your mouse over the slide numbers at the bottom to access any slide directly.
