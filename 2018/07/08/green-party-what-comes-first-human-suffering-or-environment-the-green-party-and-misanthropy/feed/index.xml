					<description><![CDATA[I am finding it difficult to keep up with Roger Lewis&#039;s  posts. Apols if I miss any. On the money tree question, I tried to follow a decades long discussion, and finally arrived at my starting view that it came down to mind-sets.
The positive money people have never answered two linked issues to my satisfaction. They seem to ingnore velocity of money circulation. If expectations are high, so is velocity, and low expectations likewise. Money responds to expectations, though it can be a two way process, hence the interminable inconclusive discussion.
The other puzzle for me is how does writing a debt off differ from the positive money concept of creating debt free money? Maybe Roger&#039;s anwer is in there somewhere, but yes, it is these two issues which allow me to see the basic income, coupled with taxes as one of the tools, to manage expectations in a way appropriate for ecological sustainability.]]></description>
