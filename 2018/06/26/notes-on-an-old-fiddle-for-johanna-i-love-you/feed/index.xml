Roger Lewis Our plans this year are to move lock &#038; stock to Sweden where I am setting up a small recording studio specialising in real Vintage Guitar Sounds. Should be fun buliding up a collection of Classic amps as well as adding to my guitar collection.We will be based in the hills outside Angleholm near Borstadt where they hold the Swedish Tennis open.We have seen a few small farms with stables and outbuildings which suit our plans perfectly.
The Estate is more than likely sold we&#039;ll see when we get back from Sweden on the 14th if our buyer is going to perform, if not the Estate will be broken up as our Bank for the main house( Yorkshire Bank\Clydesdale) has run out of patience that the place has not found a buyer or been refinanced and appointed an LPA reciever( this has nothing to do with the Carriage House or the Estate Cottages). They made the appointment literally a day before a buyer appeared for the whole place. Quite honestly the bank have been less than helpfull the past two years but they have had struggles of their own to cope with, if the sale does not go ahead then I am looking forward to working with the LPA reciever the bank have been absent for most of 2009 at least he is someone we will be able to ring and talk with.
As a family Johanna and I are just pleased to be moving on.
Whatever happens Sweden beckons.
I&#039;m looking forward to 2010, 2009 was a good year for all the right reasons for me with the birth of our Son Rasmus,a lot of other things fell into place for me also rediscovering a lot of stuff i&#039;d forgotten over the years that I wish I hadn&#039;t. I&#039;m looking forward to drawing a line under my very expensive( financially) excursion to Somerset, mind you it has been nearly Seven years now and I&#039;ve never felt happier.
A future without Bankers or Planners and lots of Music and Family activities is more than I had the imagination or even could have wished for 7 years ago.
All the best
Roger

					<description><![CDATA[When one reads a particularly Long Novel there is a pain in parting from the characters, you know you will miss them, but you know the Outcome the Grief of finishing the Book is assuaged by the closure within the pages now returned to the Library. Life, love and relationships do not give the closure one finds in departing a book which becomes one&#039;s favourite. The metaphors of new chapters and turning pages can never capture the sense of the unknown, the step into the unpredictability that lifes&#039;, emergence truly is. Yet a misfiled Library Book leads to seeking on both sides and one does not wish to end up on the wrong shelf, in the wrong library in the wrong section without a dust cover.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Roger Lewis I wrote this poem, Notes on an old fiddle, some years ago. The Poem Gun me down is written by a friend of mine. The Swedish Theory of love, described in the film of that title, is infecting the British way of doing things, this is a mistake. Whilst my friends&#039; experiences and my own are very different, the thinking behind the way that the modern Washington Consensus world operates against the liberty and natural rights of men is a sort of Stepford Sweden approach, in which Men who are men are increasingly marginalised and demonised and mischaracterised both in Culture and Law. Sweden has gone further with this than anywhere I have ever lived and it is not possible to accept the Swedish Consensus without denying who I am and where I come from culturally, Swedish consensus dictates that there are to be no dissenting or alternative views to that which is usually pre-scripted and handed down by a rather smug and deaf and blind Political Civil society Class.
