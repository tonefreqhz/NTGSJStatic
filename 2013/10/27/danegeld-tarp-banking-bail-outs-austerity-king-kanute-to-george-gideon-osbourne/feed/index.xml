					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Roger Glyndwr Lewis Matthew, Cameron and the tories are fully paid-up members of the Church of Neo-Liberalism, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan are both beatified saints of the creed. Global elitism and financialised capitalism of the State Monopoly Kind ( Fascism) Has National Governments acting in the interests of Global Corporates including the Global Banks that control the Financial System and for whom the Debt Based Fiat Money system has been created to serve. The problems I listed all flow from this Markets Construct that is devined by the sages in the financial media and referred to god-like by the politicians The sun has Mystic Meg and the BBC has Robert Peston. Monetary reform is about taking back the money power and making Accountability for great power publicly transparent and operated in the public interest- If you are saying there is a contradiction vis Camerons Watch, there are always contradictions in any system that is dynamic everything is part of a larger system,ergo, with respect to the Human construct of ´´The markets there is a very real sense that Camerons Watch this time around is all his own doing, he has claimed the laurels of the Recovery after all? Of course, he can not as Kanutes courtiers claimed for him control the tides of the Dollar Moon?http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/&#8230;/danegeld… [&#8230;]]]></description>
