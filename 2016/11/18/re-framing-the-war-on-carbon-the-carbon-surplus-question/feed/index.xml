					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] https://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2016/11/re-framing-war-on-carbon-carbon-surplus.html There is a pedagogical deficit in public education on Climate evidenced by ignorance of the Carbon Cycle, this is hampering debate on solutions such as those proposed by Tony Lovell in the soil carbon video (At the end of this post). Partial solutions are often attacked vigorously as a climate (no pun intended) of ad hominem dominates responses to anything not fitting the bag of nails demanded of the War on Carbon, ´´CO2 as pollution´´, hammer. http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2017/06/was-inconvienient-truth-always.html Al Gores Movie, An Inconvenient Truth has been comprehensively De-Bunked, Particularly Michael Manns Hockey Stick. It has been discredited so much in fact that one British High Court Judge recommended it should not be shown in schools without an appropriate erratum message. “The judge ruled that An Inconvenient Truth contained nine scientific errors and thus must be accompanied by an explanation of those errors before being shown to school children. The judge said that showing the film without the explanations of error would be a violation of education laws.” “BBC News. October 11, 2007. Retrieved March 21, 2015. http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2016/11/our-only-debt-is-to-nature-and-what-is.html How You Can Be Absolutely Certain That Mainstream Media Lies About Everything Caitlin Johnstone 28355 One thing that puzzles me is why when draws the conclusion that the MSM is a lie machine, Which I agree with. Then why is it the Anthropogenic Global Warming due to the CO2 Hypothesis is somehow a Truth that the MSM is Consistently Telling? I can not reconcile that contradiction, I am curious how you do yourself? Addicted to Distracted By Bruce Charlton Makes for compelling if Uncomfortable reading. http://addictedtodistraction.blogspot.se/ It will offend most readers but he has a very good point, I do not share his pessimism but the rest is hard to argue with. “People and events presented by the media as Good are always, in reality, bad; and people or events presented by the media as bad are usually (but not always) Good — and when bad people or events are not presented as Good, then they are condemned as bad for the wrong reasons. Also, if genuinely Good things happen to be presented as Good by the Mass Media; then it will invariably be the case that they also are said to be Good for the wrong reasons. Thus, the major output of the modern International Mass Media consists of only four categories: 1. Good presented as bad 2. Bad presented as Good (That is to say simple inversion) 3. Good presented as Good for a bad reason 4. Bad presented as bad for a bad reason (That is to say explanatory inversion) These four categories, which can be summarized as either simple or explanatory inversion, account for all sustained and high-impact modern major Mass Media stories without any exceptions. Therefore those who want to free their minds from the Mass Media must first avoid as much Mass Media output as possible, and secondly develop automatic negativistic behaviour towards the Mass Media output which they cannot avoid”. https://off-guardian.org/2017/06/17/the-revolution-is-being-televised-but-why/ Like    0  0 [&#8230;]]]></description>
