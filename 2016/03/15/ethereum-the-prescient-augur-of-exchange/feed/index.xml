<p>This tweet is based upon my own calculation s for a 20MH/s Genesis mining contract which cost me around 850 dollars after discount if the price of ETH goes up or down through the year the equivalent trading cash out to dollars or other Fiat Currency will obviously vary Mining rather than buying ether at todays price is a good way of smoothing out the investment so far my contract hjas yielded me just under 2 ETH in 3 days not for everyone but I think its a good investment on the upside and thedownside is of course very real although I expect ETH price to remain stable around 10 dollars whilst early earners of ETH convert some of their ETH reserves into FIAT so good luck to those guys, do your own research and there seems very little downside in mining via your own computer which is fun and will offer potentially better rewards depending on your GPU power and Electricity costs.</p>
