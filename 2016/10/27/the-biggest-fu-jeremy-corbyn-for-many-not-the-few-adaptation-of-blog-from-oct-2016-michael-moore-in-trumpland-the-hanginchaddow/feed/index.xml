					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] 0:56 how we all know that the theory can never be established merely by examples   1:01 it can only be extended by some by showing some internal   1:05 inherent logic .    So who will achieve a conversion on the Road to Damascus to depart from the crass cares of rapacious financialised capitalism. Michael Moore advocates against a US Brexit FU moment, Joseph Kennedy may well have differed. In his address on leaving London where he had been US ambassador For three years ending with the Beginning of the Blitz on London.  The British Public will fight against EU Fascisism as they endure the Blitz of the ´´Markets´´. Kennedy was skeptical about the UK and US involvement in the second World War, similar history covers the US and its ambivvalent position to the First World war. I tackle my own position on what I consider to be Moores procrustian analysis in this blog http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2016/10/michale-moore-in-trumpland-hanginchaddow.html [&#8230;]]]></description>
