					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anonymous, I have a lot of sympathy for the RON campaign vis the Leadership which is overwhelmingly White and Middle Classish, not withstanding family origins where many a cloth cap can be claimed I am sure. For me the Greens should have a AMAtrifocal Ethos and not a Patriarchal focus, strangely the CoRONation aspects of the Lucas/Bartley ticket is very Patriarchal in Nature, very TOP down and presumptuos in my own view not Caroline and Johnathan as individuals but Semiotically so, appearances do count in politics and that is not the sort of Green Party I was supporting in the 2015 much to the discomfiture of many of my Red Labour Freinds who had no argiukment against the Tory Light and BluLabour charges against the Milliband Manifesto. The Green Manifesto was far and away the most Radical but also well reasoned of the Manifestos in 2015. My Blog on the 2015 Election http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2015_03_01_archive.html  explains how Democracy as participation need AV or PR voting. This RON question is a praxis in Green Party advocacy of the system RON does not in this case offer any more than a protest Those of us tempted by the RON protes have a real empowerment in the opportunity to Prefer a single candidate for Leader to get Two Deputies.]]></description>
