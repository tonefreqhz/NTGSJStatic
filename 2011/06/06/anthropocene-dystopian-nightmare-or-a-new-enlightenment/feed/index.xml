					<description><![CDATA[ Sandor, You are being deliberately obtuse. My point is that the past 100 years of Chinese history and the last 25 years which you characterise as both Stagnant and Genocidal, and I am sure at times they have been both, is not taking into account the long history that China has of federal government of one form or another spanning back over dynasties that were very sophisticated and successful even before the Roman Empire got into its stride. &lt;br /&gt;You are quite correct my knowledge of Chinese history is not likely to gain my access to any courses on Oriental studies. This is besides the point.My point is that in your hurry to stride purposefully into the future in your shiny space ship you completely dismiss the areas in which we are still to get it right here in our home planet.Frankly it is your attitude that is coming across as something a little less than educated. &lt;br /&gt;My views are expressed here and I am happy with them as they are expressed If you do not have anything constructive to enrich the shortcomings in our own knowledge then perhaps it is best not to descend into the rather un edifying spectacle of you spitting your dummy out.&lt;br /&gt;1 hour ago&lt;br /&gt;I removed this comment the participant that professed offence has now removed themselves from the discussion.]]></description>
