					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] May, the talking heads tell us, is going to serve and do her duty. David Lammy spins his own theories As they all do, all the Neo-Liberals who practice the love that dares not speak its name! It feels more like being Pissed on Golden Shower Economics not Trickle Down! They have no clue or interest where it would inconvenience them, about what it&#8217;s all about. Yvette Cooper, Tom Watson, Crow Pie is on the menu and as with the Tories all the Blue Red and Yellow Neo-Liberals and their  Austerity England, there is simply not enough Crow  Pie to go around, the Establishment has been caught out yet again by its own Hubris and arrogance. If in doubt believe in something says Lynton Crosby, I say when you haven´t a clue shut the fuck up and listen to what you are being told, These Arrogant Bastards think their Shit does not stink, They are not merely smelly they are rancid with squalid corruption and self-conceit, Step aside and we want Our Real leader who knows that as Epictetus taught, &#8220;we have two ears and one mouth and should use them in that Proportion. Politics Idol is over! I wrote about the squalid scrabble for power after the 2010 Pantomime Here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
