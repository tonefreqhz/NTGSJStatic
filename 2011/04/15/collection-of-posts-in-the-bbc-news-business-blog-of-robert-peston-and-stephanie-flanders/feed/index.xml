					<description><![CDATA[Hi Roger,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the lead (link) given by you at your Linkedin post on &#039;democracy and Hypocrisy&#039; , and landed up here at your blog spot ! Thanks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You seems to have gone deep into the basics of global economy and studied how it works. Appreciate ! The nutshell was here at your first link; the study of Zurich University that says 147 families control 40% of he wealth of the wold. The recent Oxfam study also supports it; it says about 80 wealthy families control almost 50% of the world&#039;s wealth. &lt;br /&gt;That is the reason why world is so rightist, and there is no place for any original thought or idea. Rightists want the world to run unchanged, or else their supremacy will be lost. We must dare having children and leaving them at he mercy of these masters. It is not important who the master is, and how many of them are there to control you; it is a matter of a master attitude...that believe in controlling everyone around you, wither for you, or for your masters above. You need not own any wealth to have such an attitude. This attitude itself will ensure you everything in life. It is LOYALTY towards the masters . There are millions in the world with this wining attitude, and that is why the empire of 1% will remain ever safe for them, and dangerous for the other 99%. &lt;br /&gt;Share my blogs that depicts the above world reality, at links: http://originofestablishment.blogspot.in/, http://closedmodernworlddespitedemocracy.blogspot.in/&lt;br /&gt;http://understandinginflationinanewlight.blogspot.in/]]></description>
