<p>I think the Robert Moore take on history and his interpretation of State motivations and Private capitals motivations are very compelling, I was very impressed with his scholarship<br />and his residence in Ireland has clearly passed on more than a passing acquaintance to the magic of the Blarney stone.<br />We do a song in our band a Cover of the Blå Tuget Ebba Grön song Stadt och Kapitalet.</p>
