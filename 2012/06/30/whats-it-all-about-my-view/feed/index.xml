Rats desert Sinking Ship&#39;s they don&#39;t generally swim into them.</p>
<p>The American interest in all of this is of course not altruistic they are worried about contagion and to avoid this are trying to prop up the fundamentally unsound ponzi scheme which is also Rampant in the US.</p>
<p>The perfect outcome for US Financial Hedgemeony as well as Military is to see Europe sleep walk into a TARP for the private banks in Europe foisting austerity onto the European citizens and a system which no one in Europe would ever vote for.<br />American society particularly its lack of a safety net and the stark inequalities goes against European Sensibilities. In the same way that Europe needs to have more than Two Speeds Boom and Bust the US could use that too.</p>
<p>Politics are more evolved in Europe at the level of the population and there is a broader philosophical appreciation in Europe as to the past mistakes of Monarchs and emperors etc a lot more blood and of our own blood has been spilt over here down the centuries and The Americans really just do not have that same rich depth of social history to look back to and draw from ( What it does has has been sorely misrepresented and by disavowing its own constitution one can see just how little its current leadership thinks of it)</p>
<p>This is a re run of 2007\8 and as I have said before the whole system in the US as well is due to be called to account Full disclosure, removal of the Charter of the Fed in 2013, A debt commission to sort out the wrong doing and annulment of the odious debt. A new Bretton Woods agreeing how national Currencies will be set relative to trading currencies. An end to privately created debt based Bank money and Fractional reserve banking.</p>
<p>Propping up the zombie banks at all costs in an attempt to maintain the hopelessly corrupt and unsustainable present monetary system a second time in 5 years would be complete madness effectively that is what is being called for in Europe has been happening on the quiet again in the US on off since TARP was weaseled onto the American Tax payer.</p>
<p>Everything else is a distraction lets cut out the cancer and sort out the Money Base once and for all ( The US will not be keen they know the best way to kick their own can down the road is to Bluff. Well guys its all in whats really in your hand this RIver looks Dry to me?</p>
