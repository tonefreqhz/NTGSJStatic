					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] http://letthemconfectsweeterlies.blogspot.se/2012/09/a-visit-to-web-site-for-william.html  I think West calls em as he sees em, he is a philosopher and confirmation bias is not his stock in trade. So much of the scientific method these days is subject to patronage and patronage leads to patronisation. We are all patronised intellectually by both the State and Corporations Globalisation is not just a state lead phenomenon it is a multi national corporation construct which is against the interests of ordinary people. We are all ordinary people even CEO´s, Billionaires and Media superstars. That media fantasies are invented and pedaled to have us believe otherwise, pandering to all of our inherent desires for security and escapism. does not make the fantasies from the Corporate dream factory true. Ordinarily a bit of George Carlin might be expected here but how about some Hunting of the Snark. [&#8230;]]]></description>
