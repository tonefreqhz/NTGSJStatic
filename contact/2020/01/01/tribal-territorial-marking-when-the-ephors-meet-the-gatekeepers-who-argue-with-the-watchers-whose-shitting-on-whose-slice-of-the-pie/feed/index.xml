In the past century, the global economy has experienced un-
precedented growth largely due to the abundance of cheap fossil en-
ergy. However, the obsession with GDP growth since the 1950s has led
to unsustainable policies that are overwhelming the natural capacity of
the planet to absorb its waste outputs. Max-Neef (1995) provided em-
pirical evidence about the threshold hypothesis to explain that there is a
limit where economic growth does not increase the quality of life and in
fact it can decrease it. In the face of uneconomic growth, some are
calling for economic degrowth by rethinking our consumption patterns
and the need to downscale our economies (Kallis et al., 2012; D’Alisa
et al., 2014).

Exchange rates is one thing another is actually positive Interest Rates without Demurrage.
The Work of Magrit Kennedy building on that of Helmuth Kreutz is really the last Taboo of Financialised conceptions of political Economy but a Stable Unit of account defined by a falsifiable measure is key.

Positive Interest Rates are the greatest Driver of the Growth imperative, not Population Growth, The Elitist habit of always blaming the victim is every present in Woke Progressive PC circles.
Drilling into debt is another piece of the evidential jigsaw that shows that Debt/Credit is a cause of problems and not a solution to them, the basic fault in their design is Positive Interest rate that is usury.]]></description>

There are not many documentaries from recent years that are so tantalisingly near and yet so far as this one. I have added French Subtitles which can be auto-translated now to any of the languages supported by YouTube.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3jvkNRCY2s

The Upload is restricted viewing in some areas but I think my Bittubers channel will allow it to be viewed anywhere, The English Version of the film is not easily sourceable online any longer, I have looked but drawn a blank.

The Wok of Kirk Sorenson on Thorium is very important.

Euan Means who draughted the Energy Cliff graphic had this guest post from Throcon on his Blog.
