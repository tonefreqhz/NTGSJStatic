					<description><![CDATA[The Strategy of Life: Teleology and Mechanics in Nineteenth-Century German Biology
by Timothy Lenoir
really liked it 4.00  ·   Rating details ·  5 ratings  ·  1 review
In the early nineteenth century, a group of German biologists led by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Karl Friedrich Kielmeyer initiated a search for laws of biological organization that would explain the phenomena of form and function and establish foundations for a unified theory of life. The tradition spawned by these efforts found its most important spokesman in Karl Ernst von Baer. Timothy Lenoir chronicles the hitherto unexplored achievements of the practitioners of this research tradition as they aimed to place functional morphology at the heart of a new science, which they called &quot;biology.&quot;

Strongly influenced by Immanuel Kant, the biologists&#039; approach combined a sophisticated teleology with mechanistic theories and sparked bitter controversies with the rival programs, mechanistic reductionism and Darwinism. Although temporarily eclipsed by these two approaches, the morphological tradition, Lenoir argues, was not vanquished in the field of scientific debate. It contributed to pathbreaking research in areas such as comparative anatomy, embryology, paleontology, and biogeography.

Can Biology reject anything? of course, it can not a category is not a thing abounded description of a convention in practice can be described by those regarding it, it is itself as an abstract notion incapable of expressing any notions of its own! 
What this means to say is that the conventional mainstream establishment in Academic Biology expresses a view in opposition to Orthogenesis, that is quite different to &quot;Biology Rejects the idea?&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[https://youtu.be/gU-xVYLtO_E

This Varafoukis Lecture on The Nature of Money was brought to mind today after watching a more recent interview he gave to a French interview channel in February 2019, recommended to me by a French friend today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbnzQtLS4T8
In the second one He is asked to explain the Exponential Function.
@ 24.08 income was around 55 trillion just say
25:51
55 there are too many zeros to worry
25:52 about 55 the total size of financial
25:57 derivatives was 70 okay so total income
26:02 another world
55 26:05 total derivatives 70 2007 exponential
26:12 growth okay this is this global income
26:17 had risen because of globalization from
26:19 55 to 70 from in six years as a lot from
26:23 55 to 70 growth in the size magnitude
26:28 volume of the river
26:30 others from 70 to 780 , nice so to
26:38 put it bluntly planet Earth was not big
26:40 enough for this bubble say burst in 2008

Steve Keen A good friend of Varafoukis has published and been linked to here on the Physiocrats and the Energy aspects of the Economic System. The point is though that it’s not only about Energy qua energy.
Which brings me to Dominic Cummings? I actually read all of the linked-to papers and blogs, After the whole exercise I have more doubts about Dominic Cummings before I started, The Un-necessary, “I will bin you”, machismo is rather off-putting. This Talk on the Edge web site is very good, Cummings would do well to watch it and internalise the ideas. https://www.edge.org/conversation/lee_smolin-the-causal-theory-of-views
This is a very good video on Di-Electric Magnetism, now this guy is a proper misfit. What’s more, he is I think very close to scientific truth as we would get to, absent vested interests. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KooPsEE7E-Q



Smolin really is onto something as is this man.

https://www.edge.org/conversation/stephen_wolfram-mining-the-computational-universe

I had reblogged this but as it hadn’t appeared I have re-posted instead. For a Blog that purports to be about scientific rigour, it seems to me that Scepticism, essential to the scientific enquiry, should welcome other points of view. The edge site is particularly good at that, at the edges of Human Knowledge, the way forward is not placed onto a handy shelf of bumper stickers.

“All men in this and other countries are accustomed from youth
to measure the increase or diminution of wealth by dollars or other
denominations supposed to be units of value…. Even when the facts
are understood, the idea that the change is in the value of the commodities measured, and not in that of the dollar itself, is so natural
that a long and severe course of mental discipline is necessary to get
rid of it. Indeed, we question whether the most profound economist
can be entirely successful in this respect “(Newcomb, 1879, p. 230).
