Easier to remember that all cash (currency) is money, but not all money is cash and better to think of money as a medium of exchange, unit of account and standard of deferred payment.

Not true. International accounting standards say: current account bank deposits are &quot;cash&quot; money. Also, central bank notes are promissory notes, ie. credit.

Reflecting this reality, we get:
All cash is credit. All money, except gold, is credit.

Now Richard , you know I support a lot of what you say &#038; agree with most , but current account= cash is bollocks . 
And I rest my case by the fact that the international accounting standards ( popular with MMT) disagree!
All CB notes are &quot;promissory&quot; agree but not credit &#062;

There is a difference between the medium of exchange being supported by a promise and a loan being supported by a promise to repay . The former develops the note into a medium of exchange ( that every man in the street accepts as cash) an the latter a debt &#062;

Maybe it is appropriate to distinguish between currency (cash) and the reference to currency. A credit is an arrangement, where the object of negotiation is currency. =&#062; Credit is on a meta-level to currency - therefore it is not appropriate to identify credit and currency.

Almost right......where the object of negotiation is a claim on currency and it is most appropriate to separate the currency and credit components of money.

The object of negotiation is not necessarily a claim to money. It is expressed, however, in the currency: the general unit of value.
John Hearn

Correct, it is a claim on currency as well as monetary measure.

Due to the hierarchical relation of credit and currency one must note, that money in the meaning of Mxyz is not a well defined entity, because it consists of an object (currency) and claims on that object (deposits). It is more a proxy variable to map purchasing power...

“Much of this can be difficult to come to terms with. The idea that money is simply created out of thin air is alien to our way of thinking. I doubt this is accidental. My feeling is we’re schooled this way deliberately so our thoughts won’t stray towards grasping the true nature of the society imposed upon us. I have read the suggestion from (Professor Henry C. K. Liu) that when this gets properly understood it’ll be as significant as grasping that the Earth isn’t flat or that it goes around the sun.

I agree. I think the true dark ages are those we’re living in now.
