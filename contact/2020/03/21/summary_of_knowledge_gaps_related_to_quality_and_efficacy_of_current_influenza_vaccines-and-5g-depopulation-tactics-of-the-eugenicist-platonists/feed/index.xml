Dr. David Ahn7 days ago
A rational, well-thought out post. Thank you. I agree COVID-19 is to be respected, especially in you are over 60. And epidemic spread of COVID-19 superimposed on our influenza season WILL overwhelm our healthcare system (heck, a bad flu season ALONE can do that).

I credit the mess we’re in to the irresponsible early reporting of the (very) crude fatality rate of 18%, which combined with the admittedly rapid spread of the virus is to blame for the wholesale panic we’re seeing. Even as lower CFRs are continuing to be issued, it’s too late. People are too panicked to calm down now.

I’d like to go even further than Dr. Fauci in predicting an overall mortality rate well under 0.5%. An accurate case fatality rate requires both death numbers AND an accurate total case count. Sadly, hospital based testing gives you a very small subset of the total cases, as you’re only testing the more severe cases. (Half of the cases on Diamond Princess were asymptomatic.)

1. Witness the precipitous drop in case fatality rates from 17.3% in January to 3.8% in February to now approximately 0.5-1% in early March, with further drops to come. That’s not due to better therapeutics, that’s due to better data (expanded testing). (Sadly, it’s too late to put the genie back in the bottle.)

2. In South Korea, where testing is occurring on a massive scale, a CFR of 0.5% seems closer to the true rate than anywhere else where only the more severely affected are tested.

3. The Diamond Princess - while limited due to the small population and non-random selection - is revealing. Out of 3711 passengers and crew, 705 tested positive, approximately half of those were asymptomatic, and to date, 7 have died, or 1%. I could not find the ages of the deceased, but a cruise ship skews QUITE mature, so a more evenly stratified population would have a MUCH lower CFR. How much lower? Looking at China’s age banding data, 70-79 year olds have 100 TIMES the CFR as 20-29 year olds (9.8% vs 0.09%), and 80+ 100 times the CFR of 30-39 year olds (18% vs 0.18%). But more telling, going up from 40-49 to 60-69 is a 10-fold jump in CFR (0.4% to 4.6%), so if the Diamond Princess’s average age is 20 years older than the general population, we could very well be looking at an overall CFR of 0.1% rather than 1%.

Now if Korea’s 0.5% overall CFR is accurate and you scale China’s age banded CFRs based on 3.8% overall CFR to 0.5%, the CFR for 20-29 drops from 0.09% to 0.01% (13% of 0.09%), and for 80+ goes from 18% to 2.4%. This is huge. But if the Diamond Princess’s universal testing plus my admittedly rough age adjusted risk of 0.1% CFR is more accurate, this would be even HUGER (CFR for 80+ goes from 18% to 0.5% CFR). I know this is speculative, but I firmly believe once we have more data, COVID-19 will turn out to be much closer to seasonal flu in CFR than the current thinking of 10 times worse.
